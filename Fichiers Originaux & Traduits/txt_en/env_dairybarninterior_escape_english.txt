25)  DANNY
[mumbling anrgily to himself]...Seriously, how long am I supposed to stay out here?  What the hell could they be talking about in the house?  Ain't no big debate needed, keep some alive for meat, kill the rest.
26)  DANNY
[mumbling anrgily to himself]...And momma, I know you mean well, and God bless you, but you have GOT to stop playing favorites with Andy.  I know he's older, but that don't make him better.  And it certainly don't make him smarter.

64)  DANNY
[mumbling anrgily to himself]... How was I supposed to know that legless asshole would wake up?  I thought he had enough drugs in him to keep him out for the rest of the night.
65)  DANNY

[quietly]I think we can take him.
68)  LEE
[quietly]Let's get a better look
69)  LEE
[quietly]It's too risky
70)  LEE
[quietly]We just need to get to the front of the barn unseen.
71)  KENNY
[quietly]Let's take this asshole down and get my family back!
72)  LEE
[quietly]If we can get to the front of the barn unseen, we can scope things out and see what we are dealing with.
73)  KENNY
[quietly]Let's do it.
74)  KENNY
[quietly]If we can get to those doors unseen, we have a pretty good chance of taking him out.
75)  KENNY
[quietly]Those assholes still have my family!  I'm willing to take the risk.
76)  KENNY
[quietly/responing to Lee's silence]Well, I'm going with or without you.
77)  KENNY
[quietly]I figure if I can make it to the front unseen, I've got a decent chance of taking this guy out.
78)  LEE
[quietly]Yeah, maybe...
79)  LEE
Maybe you're right... but you're not going alone.
80)  LEE
[quietly]Lilly, you stay here and keep Clementine safe. Can you manage that?
81)  LEE
[quietly]Sounds good.  I'll lead.
82)  KENNY
[quietly] That dumbass is so caught up in his own rant that he probably won't see us...
83)  LEE
[Quietly] What's the plan?
84)  KENNY
[quietly]As long as we stay out of his line of sight, we should be able to sneak to the front using the stalls as cover.
85)  DANNY

93)  LEE
[whispering]I still think we can take him.
94)  KENNY
[whispering]No, Lee, I've got to get to that house.  I can make it from here, I know I can!
95)  LEE
[whispering]Don't be stupid
96)  KENNY
[whispering]No.  No, we're not screwed.  That guy is off his rocker right now.  I'm sure I could sneak past him and get to the house.
97)  KENNY
[whispering]The house isn't that far off though.  I bet I can get around him if I go alone.
98)  KENNY
[whispering] Fuck that!  That rifle kind of puts the odds in his favor!
99)  KENNY
[whispering/stern] They have my family, Lee.  I have to.

[creepy/menacing] Oh I see... y'all think you can hide from me?
105)  DANNY
