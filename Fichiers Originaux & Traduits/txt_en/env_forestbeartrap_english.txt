61)  MARK
[pickup2][Responding to "We need something that will feed all of us"] {thinkingA} No kidding.
62)  MARK
[pickup2] [cont] {disgustA} Last night I heard your friend Doug laying in bed just naming types of pie. It was driving me nuts. I think he's starting to lose it.

66)  MARK
[pickup2][agreeing that the lack of food is making everyone on egde] {normalB} Yeah, you're right.  [frustrated] {disgustB} I wish I knew for sure how much food we have left.
67)  LEE
[pickup2] {disgustA}{body-crouchAxe} You'll have to ask Lilly.  She's the one handling the rations.
68)  LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}{body-crouchAxe} Not enough.  According to Lilly we've just about hit the last of our food reserves. {thinkingA} Some people might have to go without tonight.

76)  
You'll have to ask Lilly.
77)  MARK
[pickup2] {disgustA}{body-crouchRifle} Maybe. You know some people aren't too happy about the way Lilly is handling rations.
78)  LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingB} Lilly knows it's important to keep the adults fed and functioning. {disgustA} Sometimes that means someone's gotta miss a meal.
79)  MARK
[pickup2][responding to lee's silence when asked "How much food is left?"] {disgustA}{body-crouchRifle} ...That much, huh? {sadA} Does Kenny know?

92)  LEE
[pickup2][Responding to "What's Larry's deal"?] {angryA}{body-crouchAxe} He's just an old racist asshole, that's his deal.
93)  MARK
