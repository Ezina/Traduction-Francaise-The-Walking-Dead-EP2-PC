2)  ANDY
{HappyA}Generator. You guys came along with gas just in time.

[to himself]{HappyA}Having a crop like that on hand must be great.

[to himself]Home made electric fence... good idea.
6)  LEE
[to himself]{SadA}No mail coming in or out these days.
7)  DANNY
Yeah, we don't really use that much any more.  We've only got the one cow left, and we've already moved most of her hay.
8)  LEE
Lots of hay.
9)  DANNY
Yeah. It's for our cow. People are always surprised at how much those things eat.
10)  LEE
{ThinkingA}Anything I can do to help out?
11)  DANNY
{NormalB}Nah, nothing else to do over here.
12)  ANDY
{normalB}Uh, any weapons you got, {normalC}you got to leave outside. Can't have 'em in the house.
13)  ANDY

20)  LARRY
{angryA}Well, Lee could have brought food back for all of us, {normalC}not just the people staying behind.
21)  LEE
{normalC}Well, Ben was still too afraid of a Bandit attack to come with us.  {normalB}But he still needs to eat.
22)  LARRY
{normalC}If ya ask me, that kid needs to grow a pair.
23)  LILLY
{normalC}Well, Doug's got the place set up so if any walkers wander up, they'll know.  {normalA}Ben will get a quick lesson in defending himself.
24)  LILLY
{normalA}I told Carley to look after him.  She knows how to handle herself.  {normalB}I'm sure she can whip him into shape if it comes to it.

[offended]{angryA}Now you listen here-
26)  KENNY
{sadA}Hey, Lee... can I talk to you for a sec?
27)  KENNY
[quietly] {angryA}I don't know, it was locked.
28)  LEE
[quietly] {angryA}What's in it?
29)  KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}It's probably nothing, but... {normalA}I was in the barn helping to move some hay, {thinkingA}and it looks like they got a storage room in the back.
30)  KENNY
[quietly] {thinkingA}While no one was looking, I got a quick peek through the door . {angryA}They got a bunch of cardboard boxes in there, man. [acuseatory]{normalB}They're stockpiling something, {angryA}and someone's gotta find out what it is.
31)  LEE
{normalC}What's up?
32)  LEE
[alt. To Himself]{DisgustA}At least they don't have to worry about bill collectors anymore.
33)

34)  LEE
[pickup1][looking at the barn doors]You keep the livestock in there?
35)  ANDY
[pickup1][when asked about keeping livestock in the barn]Used to.  Now it's just the one cow, and she's not doing too good.
36)  ANDY
[pickup1][alt - depending on who is closer to the Barn Loft]Yeah, we dont really use that much any more.  We've only got the one cow left, and we've already moved most of her hay.
37)  ANDY

[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}Doesn't look very safe, but I guess that's the point.
59)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}Wonder how much food they've got in there. {ThinkingA}Hopefully we'll find out.
60)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] Brenda's been cooking a long time.
61)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}Quaint. Doesn't offer much in the way of protection, though.
62)  LEE
[pickup2] {ThinkingA}They're storing gasoline all over the property.
63)  LEE
[pickup2] {ThinkingA}Gas keeps the generators going and the generators keep the fence going.

[pickup2] I don't know about these folks. Better have a look around once we're inside.
65)  ANDY
[pickup2] Ya'll can see how we've kept this place so safe.
66)  MARK
[pickup2] The fence keeps them out?
67)  DANNY
[pickup2] You betcha. They fry like bugs in a zapper.
68)  ANDY
[pickup3] We're pushing 4000 volts through that thing, with generators and amps.
69)  CARLEY
[pickup2] I'm going to assume that's a lot...
70)  
Ever have any accidents?
71)  
This is a brilliant set up.

We can't have the kids around the fence.

[pickup2] Ever have any accidents?
75)  ANDY
[pickup2] [happy as a clam] Suits us just fine.

[pickup2] [happy as a clam] Suits us just fine.
76)  LEE
[pickup2] [impressed] This is a really brilliant set up.
77)  LEE
[pickup2] We've got kids in our group, doesn't seem safe to have them near a lethal fence.
78)  DANNY
[pickup2] Uh, what Andy means is we got plenty to keep them entertained AWAY from any danger.
79)  ANDY
[pickup2] Your kids got ears, right? Make sure they use 'em.
395)  DANNY
[pickup2] Your kids got ears, right? Make sure they use 'em.

94)  LEE

95)  BRENDA
[pickup2] These are for ya'll. Baked fresh this morning.
96)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Andy, be a darlin' and take that gas back to generator four, near the kitchen. She's low.
97)  DANNY
[pickup2] [proud]Can't get stuff like that anymore, not without a cow for milk and butter, that's for sure.
98)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Amazing!
99)  BRENDA
[pickup2] That's right. Hopefully Maybelle will make it through this bout of whatever she's got and be with us for a good-long while.
100)  BRENDA
[pickup2][quiet, talking in a background convo]  I'm not so sure, it's not like last time, and back then we had help.

110)  DANNY

111)  BRENDA
[pickup2][excited] A vet! Oh, my! Our prayers have been answered!
112)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Well how about this, ya'll go get your veterinary friend, and I prepare some dinner. A big feast for all you hungry souls.
113)  BRENDA
[pickup2] What dy'all say?
114)  LEE
[pickup2] Your cow is sick? What's she--
115)  LEE
[pickup2] Lets go guys. We've got what we came for and we've got our group to get back to.
116)  BRENDA
Oh, ya'll are leavin? Ah. Well that's just too bad, I was thinkin--
117)  MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] Come on, guys! This is our chance. We help these guys out and we're OUTTA that dingy motor lodge.
118)  CARLEY
[pickup2][in a huddle] I don't know, Mark. We just met these people.
119)  CARLEY
[pickup2][in a huddle]It's not that cut and dry.
120)  MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] BISCUITS, CARLEY. Biscuits.
121)  MARK
[pickup2][outburst] Deal! We'll get our vet friend and bring the crew back here!
122)  MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] She's a sweet southern lady who just gave you BISCUITS.
123)  CARLEY
[pickup2][in a huddle] We let Lee decide.
124)  MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] Come on, Lee.
125)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Why don't I head back with the food and round up everyone for the trip back here.
158)  DOUG
[pickup2] Why don't I head back with the food and round up everyone for the trip back here.
126)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Wonderful! Family dinner at seven! Til then, ya'll come and relax.
127)  
We help them.
128)  
I don't like like it. We go back.
129)  CARLEY
[pickup2]You sure?
130)  LEE
[pickup2]Mark's right. We help them and they help us and we upgrade our living situation.
131)  LEE
[pickup2] The sons might be a little strange, but what other choice we got?
132)  LEE
[pickup2] We're happy to help. Dinner sounds great.
133)  MARK
[pickup2] You betcha.
134)  BRENDA
[pickup2] And I'll get to findin' something to put in your bellies.
135)  ANDY
[pickup2] Mark and Lee, you get settled in and find me when you're ready to help me re-secure the perimeter.
136)  CARLEY
[pickup2] We should hedge our bets. We don't know if these folks want to host a whole group for the duration. I'll hang back at the motor inn with the new kid and give the rest of the group directions back here to the dairy. The inn is a shit-hole, but we should keep some defenses there until we know we're really leaving.
137)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Send Kenny to come relieve me after dinner, prefably with a doggie bag. And if it works out, then we'll ALL make the move.
138)  LEE
[pickup2] That's a good plan, Carley. I'm sorry you're missing out.
139)  DOUG
[pickup2] Oh, wow, you guys must know a thing or two about running wire.
140)  DANNY
[pickup2] Had a guy who did, yeah.
391)  ANDY
[pickup2] Had a guy who did, yeah.
141)  DOUG
[pickup2] Definitely.
142)  DOUG
[pickup2][blurts out] We're starved!
144)  DOUG
[pickup2][blurts out] We're all starving our butts off!
145)  DOUG
[pickup2][seeing fresh food for the first time]Holy moly!
150)  DOUG
[pickup2] These guys are kinda weirdos, Lee. And that's coming from me.
151)  LEE
[pickup2] Nah, we got some food. I don't feel good about coming here. Let's go back.
152)  MARK
[pickup2]LEE! That's crazy! LOOK at this place.
153)  LEE
[pickup2] Thanks, but no thanks.
154)  DOUG
[pickup2][in a huddle] We should let Lee decide.
155)  DOUG
[pickup2] [in a huddle]Yeah, but, you know. We can't think with our stomachs.
156)  DOUG
[pickup2] [wary][in a huddle]We should think this through.
157)  MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle]BISCUITS, DOUG. Biscuits. You mean to tell me YOU of ALL PEOPLE don't like BISCUITS?
159)  DOUG
[pickup2] Send Kenny to come relieve me after dinner, maybe with a doggie bag? And if it works out, then we'll ALL make the move.
160)  DOUG
[pickup2] How about we hedge our bets. We don't want to just LEAVE our motor inn in case it doesn't work out here, right? I'll hang back there with the new kid, work on my warning system and give the group directions back here. We should keep someone at the inn until we know we're really leaving.
161)  LEE
[pickup2] That's a good plan, Doug. Thanks for taking one for the group. I'm sorry you're missing out.
162)  CARLEY
[pickup2] I see why you guys were driving such a hard bargain.
163)  ANDY
[pickup2] It's valuable stuff, I don't blame ya'll for wanting to hold onto it.
164)  DOUG
[pickup2] You must run through a LOT of fuel.
165)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Well you've come to the right place!
166)  
We're empty handed.
167)  CARLEY
[pickup2] But please, we are so hungry.
168)  LEE
[pickup2] We're empty handed. Your boys wanted fuel for food but we said we had to see the place ourselves.
169)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Oh my goodness, thank you.
170)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Ya'll should take these fresh-baked biscuits, as a sign of our good faith. Ya'll can bring a couple tanks a fuel back here as payment.
171)  DANNY
[pickup2] They brought no gas.
398)  DANNY
[pickup2] They brought no gas.
172)  BRENDA
[pickup2] That don't mean nothin'! We're St. Johns. And St. Johns help folks in need.
173)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Speaking of which, Andy, why don't you go check up on her?
174)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Pay no mind, darlin'!
175)  CARLEY
[pickup2] But we didn't bring any fuel, like your boys asked.
176)  DOUG
[pickup2] But we're all real hungry.
177)  DOUG
[pickup2] But we didn't bring any fuel, like your sons wanted.
178)  DOUG
[pickup2] [seeing food for the first time in days]Really?! Thank you so much!
179)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Well, if you change your mind...
180)  BRENDA
[pickup2]You'd be pretty valuable to an operation like this. Especially with a vet.
181)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Aww my goodness, we are sorry to hear that. We could really use the help and would make it worth ya'lls while.
182)  LEE
[pickup2] We better get going.
183)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Bye. Take care.
184)  MARK
[pickup2] [under his breath, grumpy] Worth our WHILE, Lee!
185)  DOUG

475)  LEE
[pickup2]Not really my style.

You want to leave the motel?
568)  MARK
The motel's not going to hold up much longer.
569)  MARK
So what do you think, Lee? Should we stick around here?
570)  MARK

576)  MARK
[pickup3][alt- in pain from an arrow wound, but trying to be a man about it]Yeah... I'll be all right once it's out, but, goddamn it hurts!
578)  LEE
[pickup3][explaining Lilly & Kenny Arguing.  follows #310498201] {ThinkingA}They don't exactly see eye to eye on how we should be doing things.
579)  LEE
[pickup3][explaining Lilly & Kenny's arguing] {HappyA}Each of them want to be in charge, you know?
580)  LEE
[pickup3][explaining Lilly & Kenny fighting]{ThinkingA}They have different ideas about how we should run our group.  If they don't find any common ground, this whole thing's gonna fall apart.
581)  KENNY
[pickup3]All right, Duck, let's let Clementine have a try for a bit.
582)  KENNY
[pickup3]All right, Duck, time to take a break.
583)  KENNY
[pickup3][neutral greeting]What's up Lee?
584)  KENNY
[pickup3][Duck reallly want to get back on the swing]Okay, Duck, don't pop a gasket.
585)  KENNY
[pickup3]Okay, Duck, ready to go again?
586)  KENNY
[pickup3][ambient]Not too high now.
587)  KENNY
[pickup3][ambient]Be careful .
588)  KENNY
[pickup3][ambient]Kick harder.
589)  KENNY
[pickup3][ambient]Nice air.
590)  KENNY
[pickup3][ambient]See if you can make it over the top.
591)  KENNY
[pickup3][commenting on the repaired swing]Nice work, Lee.
593)  
Does that offer apply to the rest of us?
595)  DANNY
[pickup3][normal] Had a guy who did, yeah.
596)  ANDY
[pickup3]Oh, don't worry about that.  We've got plenty to keep 'em entertained.
597)  DOUG
[pickup3][seeing the dairy for the first time]Oh, wow!  You've got enough electricity to run the whole place!
598)  CARLEY
[pickup3][seeing the dairy for the first time]This place looks untouched!  You'd never know the rest of the world is in ruins.
599)  ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He's from Macon.
600)  BRENDA
[pickup3]A couple of our old farm hands were from Macon. They grow 'em good there.
601)  ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He been living down at that old Motel round the way.
602)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Oh my goodness, that place is pretty vulnerable.  Have you got someone with survival experience to lead your group?
603)  ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He moves around a lot, but with things the way they are, maybe we can convince him to stick around for a while.
604)  ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He's ah... ya never did say where you were from.
605)  LEE
[pickup3]You were right.  I'm a local boy.
606)  DANNY
[pickup3][normal]They've got a few more friends staying at the old motel.
607)  
We work together.
608)  
Lilly keeps us focused on survival..
609)  
Kenny's working on getting us somewhere safer.
610)  
I've got things under control.
611)  LEE
[pickup3] I've got things under control over there.
612)  BRENDA
[pickup3] Sounds like a smart man.
613)  LEE
[pickup3]Kenny's working on getting us somewhere safer... He doesn't think the motor inn will stay safe forever.
614)  LEE
[pickup3]Lilly.  She's tough as nails and keeps us focused on what it takes to survive.
615)  LEE
[pickup3]We all work together.  Plus, we've got plenty of people with military experience.
616)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, I hope you know what you're doing.  That place isn't safe like it is here.
617)  MARK
[pickup3]Lilly was in the military, like me.
618)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, thats good to hear.  That motel ain't the safest place.
619)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, thats good to hear.  That motel ain't the safest place.
620)  ANDY
[pickup3][catching Lee in a lie] Hold on.  I thought you said someone else was running things?
621)  LEE
[pickup3][caught in a lie]Oh, yeah, I thought she was asking about survival tactics...
622)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, it don't matter.  You're here now.  We'll make sure you're safe and comfortable.
623)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Now that y'all are here, we'll make sure you're safe and comfortable.
624)  LEE
[pickup3]Does that offer apply to the rest of us?
625)  DOUG
[pickup3][stuffing buscutis into his mouth]Sorry.
627)  BRENDA
[pickup3]It'll be nice to have some folks to help out around here again. Danny, why don't you come help me out in the kitchen.
628)  DOUG
[pickup3]No problem.  Ben can come with me.
629)  ANDY
[pickup3]You might wanna take someone with you. Remember, those roads can be dangerous.
630)  MARK
[pickup3]Take this.
631)  BEN
[pickup3]Thanks.
632)  MARK
[pickup3]Why don't you go ahead and take Ben along anyway.
633)  CARLEY
[pickup3]I can handle myself.
634)  CARLEY
[pickup3][heartfelt] Take care of yourself, Lee.  See ya in a while.
635)  DOUG
[pickup3]All right!  See ya later!
636)  ANDY
[pickup3] Mark, Lee, why don't ya take a look around.  Once ya get settled in, I could use some help securin' the perimeter.
637)  ANDY
[pickup3]Sometimes, the dead get tangled up in the fence before they fry and end up knocking over a post.  It'd be a big help if you two could walk the perimeter.
638)  LEE
[pickup3]Is there a problem? [with the fence?]
639)  MARK
[pickup3]  [slightly hushed] This place is INCREDIBLE!!  It's got food!  And that fence... oh man that fence!! If we play our cards right, this might turn out to be a place we can stay. So how do you want to play this?
640)  
We should do whatever we can to help out!
641)  
Let's make sure the place is safe.
642)  LEE
[pickup3]Before we can think about bringing our whole group here to stay, we need to figure out if this place is as safe as they say.
643)  LEE
[pickup3] They are offering us food, we should do whatever we can to make these people like us!
644)  MARK
[pickup3]Right.  Obviously THEY think it's safe, but is it safe enough for the kids?  I noticed a broken swing over there.  Not a big deal, but maybe there's other things not working that we just can't see yet.
645)  LEE
[pickup3]And checking the fence perimeter sounds like a decent way to get a good look at their defences.
646)  LEE
[pickup3]All the more reason for us to NOT fuck this up.  If Andy need's some help securing the perimeter, then that's what we do.
647)  MARK
[pickup3]I noticed a broken swing over there, too.  Fixing that up might earn us some brownie points.  Plus I'm sure Duck and Clem would love it!
648)  LEE
[pickup3]All right.  Let's go be model house guests!
649)  MARK
[pickup3]The way Brenda was talking, I get the feeling like she'd be happy to have us stay.
650)  MARK
[pickup3]All right, I'll keep my eyes open and you find out what you can from Andy.
651)  
The electric fence came on!
652)  LEE
[pickup3]The electric fence came on!  Some people started attacking from the woods and we got trapped between them and the fence!
653)  ANDY
[pickup3][flustered]I... I heard Mark yell and thought y'all were giving me the all clear! [sincere]Man, I am real sorry.
654)  ANDY
[pickup3][suprised and concerned] Bandits!? Here?!  On our property?!
655)  LEE
[pickup3][having been attacked by Bandits] I thought this place was safe!
656)  ANDY
[pickup3]Fucking bandits!  They have no right being out here on our property!
657)  DANNY
[pickup3][looking at the arrow in Marks shoulder]Holy shit!  Are you okay?
659)  KATJAA
[pickup3][seeing an arrow in Marks shoulder] Mark!  Oh my god, what happened?!
660)  MARK
[pickup3][in pain from the arrow, but manning up]Yeah, I'm fine.  I should just... pull it out...
662)  LEE
[pickup3][calming down after the attack]We ran into some people on the way up here... bandits I guess.  I think it was them that attacked us.
663)  DANNY
[pickup3][normal]Food for protection. {fearA} Not like we had much of a choice, but they did stop hasslin' us.
664)  
It isn't as safe here as we thought.
665)  LEE
[pickup3]Maybe it isn't as safe here as we thought.
666)  ANDY
[pickup3]Hey kids, look what Lee got working for ya!
667)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]A swing!!  I love swings!  Just like at my treehouse!  Come on, Duck!
668)  ANDY
[pickup3][commending Lee for fixing the swing for the kids]You're a good guy, Lee.  Nice Job.
669)  ANDY
[pickup3]No wonder you're the leader of your group!
670)  ANDY
[pickup3]Hey, I remembered seeing kids in your group, so I went ahead and fixed that swing while you were out.  Hope you kids like swings!
671)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][stops to thank lee before running off to play]Thanks Lee!  You're the best!
672)  ANDY
[pickup3]Anytime.  We're looking out for ya!
673)  LEE
[pickup3][for fixing the swing for the kids]Thanks.
674)  KENNY
[pickup4]What we need to do is find a way to get our whole group out here to stay.  Take this place over if we have to.
675)  LARRY
[pickup3]Cool your jets there, Rambo.  These are nice people. Let's not do anything to get us thrown out before we eat!
676)  KENNY
[pickup4]Not safe?!  This place is a hell of a lot safer than that motor inn!  I think all of us and our guns can handle a couple of punks with bows and arrows!
677)  LILLY
[pickup3][voicing her opinion but trying to keep it out of earshot]Bandits?  Are you serious?  This place isn't safe, we can't stay here.
678)  LEE
[pickup3]I'm gonna head out with Dan to find out more about these bandits.  Getting him off the property for a while should give you a chance to check out this place a little deeper.  See if there's a way to get them to let us stay for a while.
679)  LEE
[pickup3]Listen, Mark and I were scoping out the place before the bandits showed up.  Other than that, this place does seem pretty secure.
680)  LEE
[pickup3]I think getting on these people's good side is gonna be important.  They've already said they have plenty of food. If we can get them thinking that having us here will benefit them, then we all win.
681)  LARRY
[pickup3]We'll bring 'em a doggy bag or something.
682)  LEE
[pickup3]Where's Ben and Doug?
683)  LILLY
[pickup3]Since Doug ATE  half the biscuits on the way to get us, I had them stay back.  I still don't think we should be trying to stay here and someone's gotta watch the motor inn until we get back.
684)  LILLY
[pickup3]Since Carley and Ben ate some of the food on the way back to get us, she volunteered to stay behind and watch the motor inn until we get back.
685)  LEE
[pickup3]Where's Ben and Carley?
686)  LILLY
[pickup3][disgusted] Yeah, that's... real charming, dad.
687)  LEE
I'm gonna head out and help Dan deal with these bandits.  You guys should try to make friends with Andy and Brenda while Im gone.
688)  LARRY
[pickup3]Well that's easy.  I've got charm coming outta my ass.
689)  LILLY
[pickup3]They'll be fine.  We need to focus on what we are doing HERE.
690)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Looks like the fence runs around the entire property, not just the house.
691)  ANDY
[pickup3] {NormalA}Yep. Can't take any chances when it comes to safety.
692)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}The fence is fantasic.  We'll do whatever you want to help keep it running.
693)  ANDY
[pickup3]{HappyA}Well, clearing that perimeter is gonna be a big help.  Just let me know when you're ready.
694)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself]{ThinkingB}I guess Mark and I were lucky we weren't touching this thing when it came on.
695)  ANDY
[pickup3] You betcha. They fry like bugs in a zapper.
696)  LEE
[pickup3] {ThinkingB}Make it safe for Clem and Duck, and let the St. John's know we can pull our weight around here.
697)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself looking at the broken swing] {ThinkingA}Looks like it just needs a new board for the seat and some rope.
714)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself looking at the broken swing] {ThinkingA}Looks like it just needs a new board for the seat and some rope.
698)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{SadA}Too bad it's broken. {ThinkingA}I'll bet Clementine and Duck would have loved something like this to play on.
699)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{NormalA}Kids used to like that old swing even more than the tour sometimes!
700)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{HappyA}I'll bet.
701)  
Mind if I try to fix it?
702)  
How long since it's been used?
703)  
How did it break?
704)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{HappyB}Sure!  That'd be great!  Momma sure does appreciate you all helping out.
705)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{HappyA}Mind if I fix it?
706)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard] {HappyC}Amen to that.
707)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard] {HappyA}I look forward to a day when kids can just be kids again.
708)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{ThinkingA}Been quite awhile. Don't exactly have a lot of kids visiting anymore.
709)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{DisgustA}When was the last time it got any use?
710)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{ThinkingA}How'd it break?
711)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{SadA}Got busted the first day those... things showed up.  Thank God no one was on it at the time.
712)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{ThinkingA}Looking for a place to relax before dealing with the outer fence?
713)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{DisgustA}Nah. Just looking around.
715)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}I've got some rope that should work...
716)  LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}I'm gonna need some rope.
717)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}...And there's got to be a board around here I can use as a seat.
718)  LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}...But that board I found is too long.
719)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}...And I've cut the board down to the right size.
720)  LEE
[pickup3][looking in the storage bench]{ThinkingA}This rope is perfect for the swing.
721)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Everything in here looks safe.  {ThinkingB}And now I know where to find some rope in case they need help tying anything down.
722)  LEE
[pickup3][looking in the storage bench]{DisgustA}Nothing else I need in here.
723)  LEE
[pickup3][looking at the fixed swing]{HappyA}All fixed.  That should make everyone happy!
724)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}This board is good, but I need some rope.
725)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}This rope will work great as soon as I find a board the right length.
726)  LEE
[pickup3][getting ready to fix he swing] All right, this shouldn't be too tough.
727)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}I'll bet they go through a lot of wood keeping those fences repaired.
728)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}This is too big right now, but if I can find something to cut it down to size, this might make a good seat for the swing.
729)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Mind if I use one of these boards?
730)  ANDY
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Already making some repairs, huh?  I like a guy who takes some initiative!  {HappyA}Yeah, go right ahead!
731)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}If a couple of tools out in the open is unsafe as it gets, we'll be fine here.
732)  LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}Would have been nice to have one of these back at the motor inn.
733)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Could be useful if I find some boards to cut.
734)  LEE
[pickup3][taking the saw in anticipation of cutting some boards.]  {ThinkingB}Hmm...
735)  BRENDA
[pickup3]You know, I used to push Andy and his brother out here on that swing every night when they were kids. [sighs] Seems like such a long time ago now.
736)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Did you say something darlin'?  [Then notices the repaired swing - Happy!] Oh my goodness. Did you do that?
737)  LEE
[pickup3]Just trying to help out a bit around here.
738)  LEE
[pickup3][calling out across the yard] Hopefully our kids will like it too.
739)  LEE
[pickup3]Yeah...it does.
740)  ANDY
[pickup3][calling out across the yard]Nice work, Lee. Things are starting to feel like they used to again.
741)  ANDY
[pickup3][seeing that Lee fixed the swing - To himself]Well I'll be damned.
742)  ANDY
[pickup3][calling out across the yard]Momma's gonna be thrilled to see that old swing all fixed up.
743)  ANDY
[pickup3][genuinely curious as to what Lee is working on.  NOT suspicious.]{SurprisedA}Hey... {DisgustA}What are ya fixing to do around the barn?
744)  ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]{ThinkingA}Ah, there'll be plenty of time for all that stuff later, after we go fix up the fence on the outer perimiter.
760)  ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]{ThinkingA}Ah, there'll be plenty of time for all that stuff later, after we go fix up the fence on the outer perimiter.
745)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Just trying to find more ways to help out!
746)  ANDY
[pickup3]{HappyA}Well, I appreciate that!
747)  ANDY
[pickup3]Tell ya what, {HappyB}We'll find ya something to do over there after we get back from securing the perimeter.
748)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
755)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
757)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
759)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
749)  LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}How secure is your barn?  Having a safe place for the cow is pretty important.
750)  ANDY
[pickup3]{NormalA}Thanks to the fence, nothing gets in here anymore.  {SadA}Unfortunately the deadies took most of our cattle before we got it running.
751)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Mind if I take a look?
758)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Mind if I take a look?
752)  ANDY
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Sure, but why don't we do that after we tend to the perimeter?
756)  ANDY
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Sure, but why don't we do that after we tend to the perimeter?
753)  LEE
[pickup3][responding to"What are ya fixing to do at the barn?"]{ThinkingA}Nothing.
754)  ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]{ThinkingA}Just giving yourself the tour, huh?
761)  
Just trying to help out.
762)  
I'm curious about your barn.
763)  
Nothing.
764)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - looking at the ribbons]{ThinkingA}These people put a lot of love into this dairy.
765)  ANDY
[pickup3][heartfelt]{SadA}This place was my daddy's life.  It meant everything to him.
766)  LEE
[pickup3][calling across the yard]{ThinkingA}This dairy won a lot of ribbons in it's day, huh?
767)  ANDY
[pickup3]{DisgustA}Then one day the world changed...Now this place is all we have left of Daddy.  {ThinkingA}That's why we take such good care if it, and why we want to share it with good folks like yourselves.
768)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Is that right?
769)  LEE
[pickup3]{NormalA}My folks stopped after two as well.
770)  ANDY
[pickup3][heartfelt]{HappyA}You know, when he first bought this place, this was a single story house.
771)  ANDY
[pickup3][heartfelt]{ThinkingA}After us kids were born, he insisted on adding a second floor.  Said they had to have room for as many babies as they could have. [with a smile]{SadA}...Momma was done after Dan.
772)  LEE
[pickup3][taking in a deep sniff] {HappyA}Mmmm, fresh herbs!  I can hardly wait for dinner!
773)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing][laughing]
774)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing]Push me higher!
775)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing]Wheee!
776)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing][giggling]
777)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing][giggling3]
778)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing]This is fun!
779)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing]I have a swing at my house too!
780)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing][giggling2]
784)  LEE
[pickup3][Responding to mark asking"how do we play this"]We'll just play it by ear.
785)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, you must be the veterinarian in the group!  Why don't you help me get your friend patched up, then we can talk about our poor cow.
786)  BRENDA
[pickup3]I've been fixing wounds around here for years. I've got enough gauze and needles to last a lifetime!
787)  KATJAA
[pickup3]Well, if you need help, I can keep the wound clean while you apply the stitches.
788)  KATJAA
[pickup3][concerned about Mark's wound]Do you have any antibiotics or anything to stop infection?
789)  DANNY
[pickup3][folows  310497904] They're hard to pin down, but I think I know where at least ONE of their camps are.
790)  LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I hope Mark is okay in there.
791)  LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}If there's not enough room in the house for all of us, I guess a few of us could camp out in here in shifts.
792)  LARRY
[pickup3][joking around/flirting]Well, we'll just see about that.
793)  BRENDA
[pickup3][process in the distance][joking around/flirting]Oh, Larry, now you behave or you won't get your hands on my biscuits all night!
794)  LARRY
[pickup3][process in the distance][joking around]...I haven't had biscuits like that since I was in the service!
795)  LEE
[pickup3][looking at gas cans][follows 310497452]{ThinkingB}We'll just have to make sure the kids don't get into it.
796)  LEE
[pickup3][follows 310497311]{ThinkingA}We're gonna need to learn how to maintain it if we end up staying here.
797)  LEE
[pickup3][looking at bales of hay] {ThinkingA}Enough of these might work as adequate cover from arrows if that becomes a problem.
798)  LARRY
[pickup3][ambient][process muted or positional]I know what you mean.  My girl is what keep me going.  If it weren't for her, I dont know if I'd bother putting up with what this world's become.
799)  BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient][process muted or positional]Oh now don't say that, we all have to look forward to something better.  At least we got our health!
800)  BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient]Oh I manage just fine.  Plus I have my boys to help out.  I couldn't do it without them.
801)  LARRY
[pickup3][ambient]So how does a woman like you self run this whole place?
802)  BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient][Laughs.]
843)  BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient][Laughs.]
803)  LARRY
[pickup3][ambient][process muted or positional]ah, ya better tell that to my ticker.
804)  MARK
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}So what have ya found out?  Is this looking like a good place to stay?
805)  LEE
[pickup3]{NormalA}I'll keep looking around.
806)  LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I didn't get a chance to check out the barn area yet.  {NormalA}I'll do that after after helping Andy get the perimeter secured.
807)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}The fence is no joke, at least around the house.  I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of it.
808)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}The generator might be a problem.  Andy said it's "tricky" and repairing it takes him a while.
809)  
I can't check the barn yet.
810)  
That fence is no joke!

The Generators might be a problem...
812)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Still, it's a hell of a lot more secure than the motor inn.
813)  MARK
[pickup3]{ThinkingB}All right.  Keep me posted.
814)  MARK
[pickup3]{ThinkingB}So what's your read on Andy so far?  Think they'd be open to letting us stay?
815)  MARK
[pickup3]{HappyA}I knew that'd be a good idea!
816)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}He and Brenda both seemed real happy to have that swing fixed.

Securing the perimeter will help a lot!
818)  MARK
[pickup3]{HappyA}We'll be getting in good AND making this place safer for us!
819)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Getting the perimeter secured is gonna help us a lot.
820)  LEE

821)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - looking at the generatior]{FearA}I'm glad Andy knows how to fix this if something goes wrong.  {ThinkingA}I'm clueless about this stuff.

[pickup3]{SadA}Dammit.
823)  LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I may have pushed too hard asking Brenda about her house...
824)  
Andy seems open to guests.
825)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Andy tells me they've had guest stay here before.  That tells me they are open to the idea.
826)  MARK
[pickup3]{HappyB}Thats fantastic!
827)  
Andy might think we're dangerous.
828)  LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I may have turned Andy off when talking up our guns.
829)  MARK
[pickup3]{AngryA}Shit, well ... do something to turn him on again!
830)  MARK
[pickup3]{SadA}You know what I mean.
