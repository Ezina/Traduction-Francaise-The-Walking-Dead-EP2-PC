1)  BRENDA
Sittin' out here, looking over the farm, I can pretend that things are like they used to be.
2)  BRENDA
[pickup2]That's the world we're living in now, I guess.
3)  LEE
{normald}I'd still like to check on him.
4)  BRENDA
[pickup2]{sada}You're gonna have to trust me on this one, Lee.  {normala}I've helped stitch my share of wounds...I know what I'm talking about.
5)  BRENDA
Just you wait, Lee, things are gonna seem so much nicer once you've all had supper and a good night's rest.
6)  BRENDA
[Shot in the head]
7)  BRENDA
[ Zombie growl  sound]
8)  BRENDA
[long prayer] Bless us, O Lord...for these, Thy gifts, which we are about to receive from Thy bounty. Help us to be mindful of all our blessings, and the needs of those who have less. Especially in these desperate, trying times when we need you most.  Amen.
9)  BRENDA
[pickup2][friendly]Please! After what we've been through...you can call me Brenda!
10)  LEE
[pickup2][initiating conversation]{normalA}Mrs. St. John...
11)  LEE
[pickup2][initiating conversation] {normalA}Pardon me, Brenda...
96)  LEE
[pickup2][initiating conversation] {normalA}Pardon me, Brenda...
12)  BRENDA
[pickup2][friendly]{normalA}What's on your mind, Lee?
54)  BRENDA
[pickup2][friendly]{normalA}What's on your mind, Lee?
97)  BRENDA
[pickup2][friendly]{normalA}What's on your mind, Lee?
13)  LEE
[pickup2]{sadA}How's Mark doing in there?
14)  BRENDA
[pickup2]{normalA}Best patient I ever had. My boys get so much as a scratch and start hollerin'. {happya}He could definitely teach them a thing or two about being tough.
15)  LEE
[pickup2]Not to be rude, ma'am, how come you're out here instead of, you know...
16)  LEE
[pickup2] No no, I didn't mean for it to sound like that.
17)  BRENDA
[pickup2][jovial]Ha, you wanna know why I'm not slaving away in the kitchen, is that it?
18)  BRENDA
[pickup2]It's okay, darlin'. Got it slow cookin' in the oven. Should be ready before too long!
19)  BRENDA
[pickup2]It's nothin' interesting, I can promise you that much. Just some odds and ends. Takes a lot to run a farm, you know.
20)  BRENDA
[pickup2]Well, someone's gettin' a little curious, aren't they?
21)  LEE
[pickup2]I don't mean to pry.
22)  LEE
[pickup2]So, what do y'all keep in that barn back there? Besides cows, I mean.
23)  BRENDA
[pickup2]I was just glad you two weren't hurt. Those bandits just don't know when to quit. But my boys... they can hold their own.
24)  LEE
[pickup2]We ran into some trouble out there.
25)  LEE
[pickup2]{normald}You been getting along with Larry?
26)  BRENDA
[pickup2]{happya}He's just a big ol' sweetheart, ain't he?
27)  LEE
[pickup2]{thinkinga}Don't know if I would have used those words, exactly.
28)  BRENDA
[pickup2]{normala}Don't judge, honey. This world is bringin' out the worst in people. But if you really look, you'll catch a glimpse of humanity every now and then.
29)  BRENDA
[pickup2]Kinda peaceful out here, ain't it? Enjoy it while you can. You'll probably start hearing those monsters fryin' against the fence before too long.
30)  LEE
[pickup2]Think I'll go have a look around.
31)  BRENDA
[pickup2]Don't wander too far. Dinner will be ready before you know it.
32)  BRENDA
[pickup2]Dinner will be ready soon.
95)  BRENDA
[pickup2]Dinner will be ready soon.
33)  LEE
[pickup2] I can't believe Mark is dead. One second we're talking about your place here, the next he's got an arrow in him.
34)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Oh child, I'm so sorry. We've seen some horrible violence here. But I promise ya'll are safe.
35)  
Why are you out here instead of cooking?
36)  
What do guys keep in the barn?
37)  
Your boy is nuts.
38)  
Why do you deal with bandits?
39)  
We met a woman at the camp...
40)  LEE
[pickup2] He seemed to enjoy this woman's death.
41)  LEE
[pickup2] Your boy Danny is nuts.
42)  BRENDA
[pickup2] That's not a very nice thing to say, Lee.
43)  BRENDA
[pickup2] I'm sure he didn't. He is sensitive and willing to do whatever it takes to protect this place.
44)  LEE
[pickup2] Why did you make a deal with those people?
45)  BRENDA
[pickup2] We got a thread of humanity left, Lee. We can do more good without them in our hair by placatin' em, so that's what we do.
46)  LEE
[pickup2] What does that have to do with anything?
47)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Means you can't trust 'em. Any of 'em.
48)  LEE
[pickup2] She wasn't one of the "bandits." It sounds like they did something pretty bad to her and your marauders are still out there.
49)  LEE
[pickup2] Before she died, we met a woman out there, at her camp.
55)  LEE
[pickup2] Before she died, we met a woman out there, at her camp.
50)  BRENDA
[pickup2] I think all them folks out in the woods had drug problems.
51)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Them folks in the woods are no good, Lee. I know it was tough, but I'm glad you a
52)  
We ran into some trouble out there.
53)  LARRY
[pickup3][reluctantly leaving Brenda as lee approaches]{normalB}We'll, uh... We'll finish talking later.
56)  
How's Mark doing in there?
57)  BRENDA
[pickup3]{happyA}Well, hi there Lee!  What can I do for ya, sweetie?
58)  
How many rooms in this house?
59)  BRENDA
[pickup3]{happyA}I think with Danny's help I've got things pretty well squared away in the kitchen, but feel free to check with Andy. He's got a lot of weight on his shoulders these days so I'm sure he'd love any help he can get.
60)  LEE
[pickup3]{normalA}Can I help you with anything around the house.
61)  BRENDA
[pickup3]{happya}It'll be a while still, but it'll we worth it, trust me!
62)  LEE
[pickup3]{normalA}When will dinner be ready?
93)  LEE
[pickup3]{normalA}When will dinner be ready?
94)  LEE
[pickup3]{normalA}When will dinner be ready?
63)  LEE
[pickup3]{normalA}How many rooms does this house have?
64)  BRENDA
[pickup3]{normalb}Rooms?  Why do you ask?
65)  
Just curious.
66)  
It looks custom built.
67)  
Sorry, that was rude.
68)  LEE
[pickup3][flustered, as if caught] {surprisea}Uh... {thinkinga}Just curious I guess.
69)  BRENDA
[pickup3]{normala}Well, don't you worry about it, Lee. {happya}We've got a great big dining room that will fit your whole group.
70)  BRENDA
[pickup3][slightly offended]{angrya}Let's not start thinking too far ahead now.  {happya}[then friendly]Let's just focus on gettin' y'all a good home cooked meal tonight.
71)  BRENDA
[pickup3][happy nostalgic]{happyc}Nice of you to notice.  My husband put a lot of work into this old house.
72)  LEE
[pickup3]{happya}Well, he did a fantastic job.
73)  LEE
[pickup3][admiring]{happya}It looks custom built.
74)  LEE
[pickup3]{sadA}I'm sorry.  That was rude of me.
75)  LEE
[pickup3][flustered]{feara}Uhhh....
76)  BRENDA
[pickup3]{happyb} I believe in making a house a home.
77)  LEE
[pickup3] {happya}Your family has done an amazing job of keeping this place up.
78)  BRENDA
[pickup3] {happyb}Well now aren't you sweet, thank you Lee. The boys and I have tried to adapt as best we can, but we still keep some of our old routines to help remind us of better times.
79)  LEE
[pickup3] {normalB}What happened to the rest of your staff?
                                                                                                               
80)  BRENDA
[pickup3][feeling tragic] {sadA}We've had our share of tragedy here... just like everyone else I'm sure.
81)  BRENDA
[pickup3][feeling tragic] {sadb}Some of our staff took off to find their families soon as they heard the news.
82)  BRENDA
[pickup3] {sadA}The few that stuck around... well... {sadc}we lost most of 'em the first night those things showed up here.  It was... a tough night.
83)  LEE
[pickup3] {normalC}How has your family been holding up since ...you know?
84)  BRENDA
[pickup3]{normalA}I think it was hardest on Andy.  Dan was always more of a mama's boy, {happya}but don't tell him I said that!  [chuckles]
85)  BRENDA
[pickup3] {normalB}My boys have been my saving grace. They both left their jobs and came home to help out after the attacks started happening.
86)  
The place looks amazing.
87)  
What happened to your staff?
88)  
When will dinner be ready?
89)  
How is your family holding up?
90)  LEE
[pickup3]  {normalA}Well if anything comes up that I can help with, feel free to let me know.
91)  BRENDA
[pickup3]  {happya}Well, Lee, I sure appreciate it.
92)  LEE
[pickup3] {happyA}No problem.
98)  BRENDA
Should be ready before too long!
