[ambient conversation]What do you do for a living, Ken?
16)  KENNY
[ambient conversation]I.. uh... I was a fisherman down in Fort Lauderdale.
17)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]If we were lucky we'd bring in a Sturgeon or two, but man... Never been out in the deep sea.
18)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]Man, that sounds nice! Daddy used to take us out for largemouth bass when we were kids.
19)  KENNY
[ambient conversation]Commercially, Snapper and Yellowfin mostly. But in the summers I'd take tourists out for some sailfish!
20)  KENNY
[ambient conversation]I tell ya, there ain't nothing like fresh tuna straight from the sea - to the grill - to the plate!!  Especially the way Kat cooks it up!
21)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation]I met Ken after I opened my Veterinary office. He came in with a sick octopus!
22)  KENNY
[ambient conversation]What?  Where else was i gonna take it?
23)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]Where ya from Katjaa?  That accent sure ain't from Georgia!
24)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation][friendly]No, definitely not!  My family is from Latvia, but we moved to Florida when I was in my teens.
25)  KENNY
[ambient conversation]Dan, did you always work here at the dairy?
26)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]Me?  No, that was Daddy's business.  I ran an insurance company over in Decatur.
27)  KENNY
[ambient conversation]I hear that.
28)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, anyway, it was good business.  But then all this shit went down, and I had to come home.  Family's more important, ya know?
29)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, well Dan felt it would be best to get away from Macon for a while. Had some... trouble.
30)  LILLY
[ambient conversation]Decatur?
31)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]Well, I took over as business manager eventually. Put that college degree to work.
32)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation]What did you do before that?
33)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]	I had a real estate business, but, you know... in this economy...
34)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, Daddy always wanted you to take over anyway.
35)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]Just worked out that way, Dan.
36)  LARRY
[ambient conversation]How long ya had this Dairy?
37)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]Long as I can remember.  We grew up here.  Dan and I helped out where we could, but really this was a Mom and Pop business.
38)  LILLY
[ambient conversation]So you two didn't work here?
39)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]	So how long you been a vet?
40)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]You work with many farm animals?
41)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation][trying to think back] Ooh... well... a long time now.
42)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Early in my training I did, but then mostly it was household pets.
43)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation]I started working in a vet's office in my twenties, then got my license a few years later.
44)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Oh, yes. Wildlife Rescue Center was always bringing their injured alligators to me to get patched up before releasing them.
45)  DUCK
[ambient conversation]And alligators!
46)  CLEMENTINE
[ambient conversation]Nu uh!
47)  LILLY
[ambient conversation]So that fence does a good job of keeping the walkers out?
48)  DUCK
[ambient conversation]Once, my dad smashed one in the face with a TV!
49)  DUCK
[ambient conversation]Sorry.
50)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah. Unfortunately we lost most of our livestock before we managed to get the thing rigged up.
51)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Kenny Jr!  That is not appropriate talk at the dinner table.
52)  DANNY
[ambient conversation][mumbled]Damned walkers.
53)  KENNY
[ambient conversation]Our hunting trips have turned up nothing. The walkers are eating anything living they can get their teeth into.
54)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]	Well, ya just have to know what to hunt.  There's meat out there that'll keep you alive if ya know what to look for.
55)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Thanks again for this meal.  You have no idea how long it's been!
56)  KENNY
[ambient conversation]How've you folks managed to find food?
57)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]And what do you do Miss Lilly?
58)  LARRY
[ambient conversation]	Lilly's a military woman.  Takes after her old man.
59)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]That right?  Ever see any action?
60)  LILLY
[ambient conversation][blunt, emotionless]I have.
61)  LARRY
[ambient conversation]	Son, you don't ever ask a soldier that question, ya got it?
62)  LARRY
[ambient conversation]All you need to know is that you don't wanna fuck with her. Period.
63)  LILLY
[ambient conversation]Dad...
64)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, I'm sorry.
65)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]	Don't pay my brother no mind.  I swear he makes a hobby of chewing his own foot.
66)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]So did ya'all know each other before the outbreak?
67)  LILLY
[ambient conversation]No. We just sort of found ourselves thrown together.
68)  LILLY
[ambient conversation]But now we've gotta stick together if we're gonna survive.
69)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]	I hear ya.  Ya gotta know when to make sacrifices for the greater good, ya know.
70)  KENNY
[ambient conversation]It ain't right, though.  No kid should have to see the things they've seen.
71)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Kids are resilient, you know?  I hate that this is the way they have to grow up, but under the circumstances, I think they're doing well.
72)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]How the kids been dealing with... everything?
73)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]Maybe I should check on him?
74)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Let the man clean up. He'll be done in a minute.
75)  DUCK
[ambient conversation]Are we gonna eat soon, momma?
76)  LARRY
[ambient conversation]How long does it take to wash your damn hands?
77)  KATJAA
[ambient conversation]As soon as Lee gets back.
78)  ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, Maybelle is the only one we have left.
79)  DANNY
[ambient conversation][cont.] She provides the milk.
80)  CLEMENTINE
[ambient conversation]I like your cow.  She's pretty.
81)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]That's why we need Katjaa's help.
82)  DANNY
[ambient conversation]We'd love to have another healthy calf, but we mostly want to make sure Maybelle's okay.
