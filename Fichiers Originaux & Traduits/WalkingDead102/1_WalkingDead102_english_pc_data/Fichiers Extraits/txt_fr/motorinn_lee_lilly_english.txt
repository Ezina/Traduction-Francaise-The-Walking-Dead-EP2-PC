1)  LILLY
{normalB}If the hunting trips nearby don't work, we'll just have to head farther out.
2)  LILLY
{angryB}But this is a good spot.  {normalB}We're protected, we're close to the drug store, {thinkingA}we have a routine now and it's working.
3)  LILLY
{angryA}God, not you too.  I know Kenny wants to leave.  I think that's why he's so eager to get the RV working.
4)  LILLY
[pickup2]Yeah, well, don't expect that to change.  That's just how he is.
5)  LEE
[pickup2]It's been three months, your dad still treats me like I'm some kind of asshole.
6)  LEE
[pickup2]So HE'S the asshole.
7)  LEE
[pickup2]Does he treat you like that too?
8)  LEE
[pickup2]How do you put up with him?
9)  LILLY
{angryA}All he's got left in the world is me.  {sadA}And that goes both ways.  {disgustA}So, yeah, he's probably gonna keep treating you like crap, but that's just because he still has one thing left to care about.
10)  LILLY
{angryA}Look. My dad can be an ass sometimes, I know that.  {normalB}But' he's not a bad guy.  He just... {sadA}He's got a lot of pain.
11)  LILLY
{sadA}He's been through so much.  And lost... {sadB}pretty much everything.  {normalB}And it's hardened him, ya know?  {thinkingA}Yeah, he's bitter and hateful, but that's all just to protect himself. And me.
12)  LILLY
{angryA}So don't judge him.  And don't judge me for sticking by him.  {sadA}He's my dad, and I love him.
13)  
Oh, so he's the asshole.
14)  
Does he treat you like this too?
15)  
How do you put up with it?

39)  LEE
[pickup2]It's not so tough.
40)  LILLY
[pickup2]Good. Then you can do it again tomorrow when there's even less food.
41)  LEE
[pickup2]I don't envy you.  I don't know how you have the strength to do this every day.
42)  LILLY
[pickup2]I don't have a choice.
43)  LILLY
[pickup2][responding to silence, annoyed, flat] Whatever.
44)  LEE
[pickup2]We should talk about you and Kenny.
45)  LEE
[pickup2]The arguing.  It's getting pretty out of hand.  You know, people notice that.
46)  LILLY
[pickup2][annoyed]Look, I'm working my ASS off to make sure we have a good set up here and Kenny just doesn't appreciate that.
47)  LEE
[pickup2]But there is no food.  You know that better than anyone.
48)  LILLY
[pickup2]This is a good spot.  We're protected, we're close to the drug store, we have a routine now and it's working.
49)  LILLY
[pickup3][As if there is no other choice - responding to "But there IS no food."]Well, we'll just have to find some.
50)  LILLY
[pickup2][annoyed] What about us?

[pickup3][to himself - depressed, having givin out 2 piecesof food and running out quickly!]{sadA}Well, that's one more down.  Nine hungry people and only two pieces of food left.
62)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - depressed, having only 1 piece of food left]One more piece of food to give out, then it's all gone for today.
63)  LEE
[pickup3][knowing there is only one more piece of food left]Hm.  Maybe I should keep this for myself?
64)  
[Keep the last piece of food for yourself]
65)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - keeping the last bit of food for himself]I need to keep up my strength, too.
66)  
[Save the last piece of food for someone else]
67)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - choosing to save the food for someone else]Nah.  Some of these people have gone longer than me without food.  They're the ones that need it.
