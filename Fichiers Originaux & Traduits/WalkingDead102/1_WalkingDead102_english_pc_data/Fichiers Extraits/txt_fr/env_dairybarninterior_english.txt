[Ambient]{HappyA}This is a girl cow because boy cows have horns.
100)  DUCK
[Ambient]{ThinkingA}Can we milk the cow, momma?
101)  DUCK
[Ambient]ThinkingA}How come cowboy's ride horses and not cows?
102)  DUCK
[Ambient]{NormalB}I can see her breathing.

110)  KATJAA
{body-Sit}{HappyA}I never did thank you for saving Duck from the walkers {SadA}back at Hershel's farm.[Recorded during 101 pickups]
111)  KATJAA
[Ya know what, despite it all-]{body-Sit}{HappyA}They're doing okay.[Recorded during 101 pickups]
112)  LEE
{body-B}{ThinkingA}What do you think of the Dairy?
113)  KATJAA
{body-Sit}{HappyA}It's nice... {ThinkingA}But I don't think we should get to comfortable.  {NormalC}We don't really know these people yet, {ThinkingA}ya know?
114)  KATJAA
{body-Sit}{HappyA}The St. John's have been very friendly to them. {ThinkingA}But...[Recorded during 101 pickups]
115)  KATJAA
If something happens and you've gotta choose between the kids or them, {AngryA}don't repeat what happened with the walkers at Hershel's farm.[Recorded during 101 pickups]
116)  KATJAA
[cont.]{ThinkingA}You choose the kids this time.[Recorded during 101 pickups]
117)  LEE
[pickup1][friendly, greeting Clementine in the barn] {body-B}{HappyA}Hi, Clementine!
118)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup1][friendly, but concerned that Lee might disturb the cow]  {HappyA}Katjaa says {SadA}to walk quiet on the hay 'cause it's noisy and might upset the cow.
119)  LEE
[pickup1] {body-B}{NormalC}I think she means you kids. [Should walk softly on the hay]
120)  LEE
[pickup1]{body-B}{HappyA}Thanks.  {HappyB}I'll remember that.
121)  KATJAA
[pickup1][Asking Lee to check out the back room, but thinking he might chicken out][Follows: 310411407] {body-Sit}{AngryA}I'm not asking you to help out with surgery or anything...
122)  LEE
[pickup1][awkward, having been called out for not helping Katjaa with surgery earlier in the day]{body-B}{SadA}Listen, I -
123)  KATJAA
[pickup1][Assuring Lee an apology isn't neccessary, just do this thing instead]{NormalC}You don't need to say anything.  {SadA}Just please, {ThinkingA}get rid of Andrew for a minute so we can get a look back there.
124)  LEE
[pickup1][responding to katjaa asking for help distracting Danny in the barn]{body-B}{ThinkingA}I'll do whatever I can. [Remembering how his help didnt save David]{SadA}Maybe this time I can actually help.
125)  KATJAA
[pickup1][Lee offers help with the Barn, but regrets that his help earlier didnt save david]{body-Sit}{SadA}Lee... {SadB}you did your best with David.  So did I.  {ThinkingA}But if you want to help the rest of us, {NormalC}you need to distract Andrew and see what's in that back room.

173)  LEE
[pickup2]{ThinkingB}Hang on, man.  Think this through.  {AngryA}You smash the lock.  {ThinkingA}Then what if it turns out you're wrong?   {ThinkingB}You just fucked your chance to get a good meal in those kids you're trying to protect.  {SurpriseA}Use your head, Kenny.
174)  LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}What?
175)  KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}{AngryA}Look, {ThinkingA}that guy with Katjaa...  What's-his-name.  {DisgustA}He locked it up real TIGHT the second we came in.  [conspiratorially closer]I definitely heard a noise back there, Lee.

187)  LEE
[pickup2][just had a breakthrough thought] {Body-B}{ThinkingA}Hm!
188)  KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}{SurprisedA}What?
189)  LEE
[pickup2]{ThinkingB}See those screws?  {HappyA}Instead of breaking the padlock, we can just take off the assembly, have a peek inside, {ThinkingA}and then replace it all again, like nothing ever happened.
190)  KENNY
[pickup2]{HappyB}All right.  Sounds like you got a plan.  {ThinkingA}I'll hang around and keep an eye on that guy with the cow.
191)  LEE
[pickup2]{NormalD}Andy.
192)  KENNY
[pickup2]{DisgustA}Shit.  {FearB}I thought that {SurprisedA}was Danny.  {AngryA}Whatever.

[pickup2]{Body-B}{HappyA}Just checking out the barn here.  {HappyB}Never been to a dairy farm before.
198)  LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}What's behind this door, Andy?
199)  ANDY
[pickup2]Just tools.  We keep it locked so the people in the woods don't try and grab 'em.  We'd be dead without our tools.
200)  ANDY
[pickup2]{HappyA}Well, we're all sure glad his wife is here.  {NormalC}She's a lifesaver-- {HappyB}you got no idea.
201)  ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{ThinkingA}He's a little jumpy, eh?
202)  ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{HappyA}Okay.  Well, don't just roam around without me or Danny.  {NormalC}The farm can be a dangerous place.
203)  ANDY
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}You know, the bandits and all.  {NormalB}Sorry about your friend.
204)  ANDY
[pickup2]Hey, uh...  do me a favor.  Don't fuck around with this door.  Just, you know, Mama gets nervous.

220)  LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingB}Why do you lock that door?
221)  ANDY

222)  ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{NormalC}All righty, then.
223)  ANDY
[pickup2]  {Body-A}{HappyA}No problem.

[pickup2]Brenda must use this thing for household repairs.
227)  LEE
[pickup2]I wonder if they keep a screwdriver in there.
228)  LEE

240)  ANDY
[pickup_2]{Body-A}{ThinkingA}If you need something, {HappyA}tell me what it is, {HappyB}and I can get it for ya.
241)  LEE
[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}So... {HappyA}Where do you keep the rest of the tools?
242)  LEE
