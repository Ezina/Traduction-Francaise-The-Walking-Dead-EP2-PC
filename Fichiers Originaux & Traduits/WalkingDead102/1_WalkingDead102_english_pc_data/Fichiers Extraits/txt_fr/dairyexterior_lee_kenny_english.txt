1)  KENNY
{sadA}Hey, {normalB}they said Mark got attacked?
2)  LEE
{normalD}Don't worry, he's fine.
3)  KENNY
{normalB}He'd better be. We need him.
4)  LEE
{angryA}Bandits attacked us.
5)  KENNY
{angryA}God dammit. {thinkingA}Didn't think they'd come all the way out here.
6)  KENNY
{normalA}Least he didn't get bit, I guess.
7)  LEE
{thinkingA}I haven't seen him since.
8)  KENNY
{normalA}Hmm, should I ask Kat {normalB}to look in on him when she's done with the cow?
9)  KENNY
{normalB}Maybe, maybe not. Once we get our food, we can do a better job of defending it.
10)  KENNY
{thinkingA}Instead of just waitin' around at the motel for somebody to attack us or eat us.
11)  LEE
{thinkingA}This place isn't safe.
12)  LEE
{happyA}I'm glad you decided to come out with us.
13)  KENNY
{normalB}Yeah, well, we need the food.  {normalA}Helping this cow better be worth it.
14)  KENNY
[worried] {angryA}I noticed there weren't too many walkers around on the way up.
15)  LEE
{normalD}That's good.
16)  KENNY
{normalA}Is it? I got a bad feeling.
17)  KENNY
{angryA}Whether it's from the walkers or the bandits, there's a shitstorm comin'.
18)  LEE
{normalC}Something wrong with that?
19)  KENNY
{angryA}If we ain't seeing 'em, that means either there's a shitload of 'em waiting somewhere...
20)  KENNY
...or else somebody with a lot more firepower than us is killin' 'em off.
21)  KENNY
{normalA}Either way, I gotta bad feeling a shitstorm's brewin'.
22)  LEE
{normalD}The walkers don't worry me as much as the bandits.
23)  KENNY
{normalB}That's what I'm sayin'.
24)  KENNY
{fearA}Somethin's coming, Lee. There's gonna be a war.
25)  KENNY
{sadA}On the way over here, I was gettin' dizzy, hands shakin', cold sweats. {normalA}Thought I was gonna pass out.
26)  LEE
{normalD}They've got food here.
27)  KENNY
{angryA}I hope they feed us, Lee. Soon.
28)  KENNY
{thinkingA}Yeah, but I'm not just talking about one meal, ya know?
29)  LEE
{normalC}How you holding up?
30)  KENNY
[quietly] {angryA}If they got a supply of food somewhere, {normalA}we've gotta know where it is and how to get it.
31)  KENNY
[quietly] {sadA}In case something happens.
32)  KENNY
{normalB}Katjaa knows what's up, talk to her and she'll show you where I'm talking about.
33)  KENNY
{angryA}Find out what's in that room.
34)  LEE
[quietly] {thinkingA}I still don't like it.
35)  KENNY
{sadA}Come on, Lee, it's not just us. We've gotta think of the kids.
36)  KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}You don't have to like it, just do it.
37)  LEE
[quietly] {thinkingA}You're right.
38)  LEE
[quietly] {normalB}It's probably nothing. {normalC}What could they be hiding at a dairy farm?
39)  KENNY
[quietly] {thinkingA}Food!
40)  LEE
[quietly] {angryA}These folks deserve their privacy.
41)  KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}We just want to look, Lee. We're not stealing anything.
42)  LEE
[quietly] {angryA}We can't piss these people off, Kenny. We need them to trust us.
43)  KENNY
[quietly] {normalA}That goes both ways, Lee.
44)  LEE
[quietly] {angryA}You want ME to take a look?
45)  KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}Exactly.
46)  LEE
{normalA}Bye.
47)  KENNY
{happyA}Hey, Lee. {normalA}Nice place, huh?
48)  KENNY
{normalA}So, uh... what's up?
49)  KENNY
[after being ignored]{sadA}Well... just be careful, I guess.
50)  LEE
{normalA}Hi, Kenny.
51)  LEE
[greeting]{normalB}Hey...
171)  LEE
[greeting]{normalB}Hey...
52)  KENNY
[noticing Lee's silence]{angryA}You sense it too, don't ya?   {fearA}Man, I've got a feeling something bad is on the horizon, Lee.
53)  KENNY
[responding to Lee's silence; hushed][quietly]  {angryA}Well don't look at me!  {thinkingA}I'm no good at breaking and entering.  But somebody's gotta do it!
54)  KENNY
{normalB}What's up, Lee?
55)  KENNY
[looks at Danny] {normalB}Mind if I talk to Lee for a minute?
56)  KENNY
[looks at Danny] {normalB}Gimme a sec...
57)  DANNY
{normalB}Yeah, go ahead.
58)  KENNY
[pickup2] Man, what the fuck happened out there? You okay?
59)  LEE
[pickup2] I'm just a little shaken up. Could have just as easily been me that got killed out there.
60)  KENNY
[pickup2]Look man, Mark dying? Fucking awful... but now we know things are more dangerous out there than we even thought.
61)  
I'm just shaken up.
62)  
It's nothing.
63)  LEE
[pickup2]It's nothing, don't worry about it.
64)  KENNY
[pickup2]Hey, I get it. Mark dying... you need to deal with that in your own way. But we need to start thinking about what we came here for.
65)  KENNY
[pickup2] Glad to see you two made it out of there in once piece.
66)  LEE
[pickup2] That's one way of looking at it.
67)  KENNY
[pickup2]  Hey, it could've been worse. He could've ended up like that poor son of a bitch in the bear trap.
68)  LEE
[pickup2] Not sure Mark's gonna be as upbeat as you about the whole thing.
69)  LEE
[pickup2] [shrugging]Guess that's one way of looking at it.
70)  LEE
[pickup2] I guess Lilly isn't too thrilled about being here.
71)  KENNY
[pickup2] I could give two shits about what Lilly wants. Duck and Katjaa need food, and I'm not about to sit around that Motor Inn and watch them go hungry.
72)  LEE
[pickup2] If everything works out, maybe he and Katjaa can have an easier life here.
73)  KENNY
[pickup2][bitter]Yeah, right.
74)  LEE
[pickup2] That's in the past, Kenny. A lot's happened since then.
75)  KENNY
[pickup2] [bitter]That's funny, you didn't seem too worried about Duck when Larry wanted to throw him out into the street back in Macon.
76)  KENNY
[pickup2] [bitter] That's funny, considering you didn't seem too worried about Duck back at Hershel's Farm.
77)  KENNY
[pickup2] I hope you're right. Duck and Clementine deserve a better life than starving to death at some crappy motel.
78)  LEE
[pickup2] I'm gonna go have a look around.
79)  KENNY
[pickup2] I'll be here if you need me. Let me know if you find anything.
80)  KENNY
[pickup2] Okay, well, I'll be here if you need me.
81)  KENNY
[pickup2] Nothing? Mark's dead. That's not nothing. It's fucking dangerous out there, but you're right... we need to move on.  As soon as dinner's on the table, we're all gonna feel a lot better.
82)  LEE
[pickup2]Yeah, you're right.
83)  KENNY
[pickup2]Well, it wasn't easy. Duck didn't look so good on the walk over to this place.
84)  LEE
[pickup2] Did Duck and Katjaa get here okay?
85)  KENNY
[pickup2] We need to start thinking about what we came here for. Food. We're starvin', Lee.
86)  KENNY
[pickup2]And better it be a quick death than living in agony like that guy in the bear trap.
87)  
It's okay. We're safe now.
88)  LEE
[pickup2] It's okay. People die, it happens. But at least we're safe now.
89)  KENNY
[pickup2] Maybe we'll all feel a lot better once dinner's on the table.
90)  KENNY
[pickup2]Lee, I'm glad you're back. Did you find anything out there?
91)  KENNY
[pickup2]Holy fuck! Glad you made it back in one piece. Did she at least have any supplies out there? Food?
92)  LEE
[pickup2] I killed someone out there. A woman. She had a crossbow pointed right at my head.
93)  LEE
[pickup2] We found a woman out there. She was all alone and talking crazy with a crossbow pointed right at us. Before I knew it, Danny shot and killed her.
94)  LEE
[pickup2] We didn't find anything useful out there, but that's not what I wanted to talk about.
95)  KENNY
[pickup2][disappointed, then quitely]Figures. But hey, listen...
96)  
What did you say to Lilly?
97)  KENNY
[pickup2] [impatient]So did you find food out there or not?!
98)  LEE
[pickup2] No. Nothing.
99)  
We found nothing.
100)  LEE
[pickup2]There's nothing out there.
101)  KENNY
[pickup2]You shitting me? Nothing at all?
102)  LEE
[pickup2][forceful]I'm telling you. We didn't find anything.
103)  KENNY
[pickup2][suspicious]You wouldn't lie to me, would you, Lee?
104)  LEE
[pickup2]Kenny?
105)  
What's so special about the barn?
106)  LEE
[pickup2][clarifying][quietly]What's so special about the barn? Why would they hide something there?
107)  KENNY
[pickup2][quietly]Who knows, but whatever it is, they're holding out on us. I need to find out what they got, Lee. For my family's sake. And for Clementine.
108)  
What are they hiding?
109)  LEE
[pickup2][quietly] So what exactly do you think they've got back there?
110)  KENNY
[pickup2][quietly]My guess? Food. And based on what I saw, they have more than enough to go around. Maybe you could find a way get in there, Lee.
111)  
Stay out of it.
112)  KENNY
[pickup2] [quietly]Fuck that, man.
113)  LEE
[pickup2][quietly] Look, whatever they got back there? That's their business. We need to play it safe if we want to try to work out a deal here.
114)  KENNY
[pickup2] [impatient][quietly]Don't stonewall me on this.
115)  KENNY
[pickup2] [quietly]You need to get into that barn. They're hiding something that could help all of us.
116)  KENNY
[pickup2] Lee, I really think it's time we go find out what's in that barn.
117)  KENNY
[pickup2] Clementine's hat? Damn.
118)  LEE
[pickup2] Danny and I found this at the camp site.
119)  KENNY
[pickup2]Wait a minute, you told me you found nothing at the camp site. This don't look like nothing to me.
120)  LEE
[pickup2]Sorry. I guess I'm still trying to make sense of everything.
121)  LEE
[pickup2]Maybe whoever it was had been following us for a while. Not sure.
122)  KENNY
[pickup2] What do you think it means?
123)  KENNY
[pickup2] You did the right thing, Lee.
124)  KENNY
[pickup2] Guess it's a good thing Danny did what he did out there.
125)  KENNY
[pickup2] [frustrated]Lee, this is why you need to tell me things. If there was someone out there who would hurt Duck or Clementine, I need to know about it.
126)  KENNY
[pickup2]You should just go ahead and give Clementine her hat back. Maybe it'll make her feel more at home.
127)  LEE
[pickup2]I also found this at the campsite.
128)  LEE
[pickup2] Not sure. Not sure about a lot of things right now.
129)  KENNY
[pickup2] A video camera?
130)  KENNY
[pickup2]Think it's useful?
131)  LEE
[pickup2] Doug said the batteries are dead, and Danny lost interest when he found out it wasn't working.
132)  KENNY
[pickup2] Weird. Why would a bunch of dairy farmers want a working camcorder?
133)  LEE
[pickup2] That's kinda what I was thinking.
134)  KENNY
[pickup2]You better just keep that to yourself. Even if it doesn't work.
135)  KENNY
[pickup2]I don't like this, Lee. Something's up.
136)  KENNY
[pickup2] If that woman had touched one hair on Duck's head, I would've killed her myself.
137)  LEE
[pickup2]What exactly were you arguing about with Lilly when I came back?
138)  KENNY
[pickup2] I told her we needed to get into that barn and see what exactly they got back there. But she wants to up and leave before we even get our dinner. I don't get her, man. It's like she'd rather starve out there.
139)  KENNY
[pickup2]Besides, I think we're all gonna feel a lot better once dinner's on the table.
140)  LEE
[pickup2] Nah, I think it's broken. Danny seemed pretty interested in it until he found that out.
141)  KENNY
[pickup2][quietly]We may have bigger fish to fry here.
142)  LEE
[pickup2]What were you and Lilly arguing about when I came back?
143)  LEE
[pickup2][quietly]What's up?
144)  KENNY
[pickup2]Does it work?
145)  LEE
[pickup2] I still can't get that lock off the door.
146)  KENNY
[pickup2][reminder] Hmmm.  You probably just need a screwdriver or something.
147)  KENNY
[pickup_2]All right.  Good to hear.
148)  LEE
[pickup_2]I picked up something I think could help with the lock.
149)  KENNY
Good.  Now we just gotta keep that guy busy.
150)  KENNY
Yeah.  He's been... watching.
151)  LEE
Andy.
152)  KENNY
I wish that guy would just leave...
153)  KENNY
[pickup_2]Nothin' to stop you now.

Danny killed someone.
157)  
I killed someone.
158)  
Lilly doesn't want to be here.
159)  
Your family made it here okay?
160)  
How you holding up?
161)  KENNY
[pickup3][follows # 310481005]You're with me on this, right?
162)  LEE
[pickup3][agreeing with Kenny that Lilly is wrong about the motor inn]Yeah, of course.  Lilly's judgement is clouded, but you've got a pretty clear head about these things.
163)  LEE
[pickup3][disagreeing with Kenny about the motor inn]Lilly's been doing a good job of keeping the group together.  You need to back off a bit.
164)  LEE
[pickup3][not siding with anyone about the motor inn]You're not making me pick sides, Kenny.
165)  KENNY
[pickup3][disapointed in Lee for siding with Lilly] Whatever.
166)  KENNY
[pickup3][in ernest]Well... you better think about it, because that time is coming.
167)  
Yeah, of course.
168)  
No. Lilly's been doing a good job.
169)  
I'm not choosing sides.
170)  KENNY
[pickup3][responding to Lee's silence and refusal to pick sides] Hmf.  Always the diplomat.
172)  KENNY
[pickup3] Hey Lee, found anything interesting?
173)  KENNY
[pickup3] Good to know. Keep your ears open for anything else that might help us.
174)  LEE
[pickup3] I'm just trying to make sure this place is secure, in case we decide to make this a more long term solution.  Except for those people in the woods, it seems pretty safe.
175)  KENNY
[pickup3] That's true.  Well, it's good to know what we're working with here.
176)  KENNY
[pickup3] Keep looking around and let me know if you find anything else.
177)  LEE
[pickup3] I was talking to Andy a bit earlier, it doesn't sound like they have too many guns around. They rely mostly on the fence to keep them safe.
178)  LEE
[pickup3] Well that's the problem, when there's no more gas, there's no more fence.
179)  KENNY
[pickup3] Hey Lee, how's it going with the St. Johns?
180)  LEE
[pickup3] Good. I was talking to Andy earlier and offered our group's assistance on the dairy.
181)  KENNY
[pickup3] Great. Sounds like they're starting to accept us.
182)  LEE
[pickup3] Definitely.
183)  LEE
[pickup3]I don't think they have much to protect them besides the fence so he seemed pretty appreciative.
184)  KENNY
[pickup3] Yeah, this place is sure a step up from that shithole motor inn.
185)  LEE
[pickup3] They seem like good people. If we play our cards right, I still think it could work out for us here.
186)  KENNY
[pickup3] Don't wait too long to help scope out that bandit camp. It'd be a good opportunity to find a bit more out about the St. John's and their relationship with those... bandits or whatever.
187)  LEE
[pickup3] Right. I'll see what I can find out.
188)  LEE
[pickup3] Good idea.
189)  KENNY
[pickup3] Don't wait too long to help scope out that bandit camp.  Sounds like they're pretty amped up about it. This might be a good way to earn their trust.
190)  KENNY
[pickup3]So as long as you're on THIS side, things are all right.  Provided the fence holds out.
