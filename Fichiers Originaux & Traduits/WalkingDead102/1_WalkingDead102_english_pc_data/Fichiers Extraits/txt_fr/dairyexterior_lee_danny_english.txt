1)  DANNY
{normalC}Remember: we're just doing reconnaissance for now. No use getting ourselves killed.
2)  DANNY
{normalC}What do you think of the place?
3)  LEE
{normalA}It's beautiful.
4)  LEE
{normalC}How?
5)  DANNY
{normalC}It's cool.  {normalB}You don't have to decide right now.  {normalA}But don't wait too long, or you may not have a choice.
6)  DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Hi ya, Trigger.
7)  DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Glad I got to use her today.
8)  DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}My girl, here.
9)  DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Hello.
10)  
You really like that gun.
11)  
What's with the wheelbarrow?
12)  
This place is isolated.
13)  
You run this place with just one cow?
14)  LEE
{normalA}[pickup2] You really like that gun.
15)  DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}What's not to like?
16)  
Not much, I guess.
17)  
It's just a gun.
18)  
Just kinda creepy, that's all.
19)  DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Exactly.
20)  LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}Not much, I guess.
21)  DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}That's where you're wrong. This is Charlotte. She's as faithful as a starvin' hound when you got a bone in your pocket.
22)  LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}It's just a gun.
23)  LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}Just kinda creepy, that's all.
24)  DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Times like these, a .243 will keep you warmer at night than any lady I ever known.
25)  DANNY
[pickup2] Things happen on a dairy. Cut myself darn bad just the other day. Blood everywhere.
26)  DANNY
[pickup2] I'm tough.
27)  LEE
[pickup2] I saw a wheelbarrow over there, full of garbage. Some bloody clothes.
28)  LEE
[pickup2] You seem okay.
29)  LEE
[pickup2] You guys are pretty out in the sticks, here.
30)  LEE
[pickup2] You get many visitors?
31)  DANNY
[pickup2] Not anymore. Bandits, of course. Used to get these school kids on tours back before the dead time.
32)  DANNY
[pickup2] [creepy] [we are] Hard to find.
33)  DANNY
[pickup2] Yeah, kids laughin' and playin'. All the girls runnin' around here in their springtime dresses. It was nice.
34)  LEE
[pickup2] [a little on edge]That right?
35)  DANNY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] Used to have more. They get hungry, too. Or sick. Got your doctor friend here now, though.
36)  LEE
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] How do you run this place with just one cow?
37)  LEE
[pickup2] You guys must trade for a LOT of fuel to keep the generators running, right?
38)  DANNY
[pickup2] People get hungry and a few loaves of bread fetch a high price. Ya'll are lucky you're on this side of the deal now.
39)  DANNY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] It'll be a good one.
40)  LEE
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] I'm going to go wait for supper, then.
