431)  LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Could there be a hole behind these pallets...?
432)  LEE
[pickup2]No such luck.
433)  LEE
[pickup2][to himself]What's this...some kind of vent?
434)  LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Too small to do us any good.
435)  LEE
[pickup2][to himself]But there's no way out through the ceiling.
436)  LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Shelves are pretty sturdy. We could climb up...

[pickup2][alarmed]Dad!  You can't get--
441)  LEE
[pickup2][to himself]I wonder.... [louder, to the group]There ought to be an air duct behind this unit... maybe big enough for one of us to fit through....
442)  KENNY
[pickup2][dubious] I dunno, Lee... seems like a longshot.
443)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][hopeful]Does the air-conditioner come off?
444)  LEE
[pickup2][examining the unit]I think I could take it off... if I had something to remove the screws...
445)  LEE
[pickup2][crestfallen]Of course they took it. Shit.
446)  LEE
[pickup2][remembering]The multitool!
447)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][hopeful]Maybe there's something else we could use.  I've got a rock.
448)  LEE
[pickup2]A rock won't help... [thinks]but a COIN might do the trick.  Do you have a coin?
449)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][disappointed]Uh-uh...
450)  LEE
[pickup2][to himself]That air-duct is our best bet for getting out of here!
451)  LEE
[pickup2][to himself]I just need a coin or something to remove the screws...
452)  LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Just gotta remove these screws and get this unit off...
453)  LEE
[pickup2][biting the bullet, slowly and clearly]I think I may have found a way out of here.  But I need something to remove the screws on the air-conditioner.
454)  LILLY
[pickup2][flatly]No.
455)  LEE
[pickup2][uncomfortable]If you had something I could use as a screwdriver...a coin or something...
456)  LEE
[pickup2][uncomfortable]What about HIM?  Look, I know this is a terrible time for it, but...
457)  LEE
[pickup2][continuing, uncomfortable]...back at the Motor Inn, Larry mentioned something about keeping coins in his pockets...
458)  LEE
[pickup2][continuing, uncomfortable]...if there's a chance Larry has a coin or something in one of his pockets...it might be the thing that saves our lives.
459)  LILLY
[pickup2][under her breath] Fucking vulture...
460)  LEE
But if we're gonna get out of here, we need your help.  And Larry's...
462)  LEE
But if we're gonna get out of here, we need your help.  And Larry's...

468)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][more sobbing]
469)  LEE

474)  LEE
[pickup2][consoling her] I'm workin' on it!
475)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][shyly]We're gonna get out, right? You found a way out?
476)  LEE
[pickup2]They didn't hurt you, did they?
477)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][answering in the negative]Mm-mm.
478)  LEE
[pickup2]The air-conditioner... there might be a duct behind it....
479)  KENNY
[pickup2][distracted, not listening] Oh God!  What're they doin' to Katjaa and Duck...?
480)  LEE
[pickup2]If the duct behind the air-conditioner is big enough, we might've found our way out of here...
481)  KENNY
[pickup2][hopeful] Yeah?
482)  LEE
[pickup2] But I need something to loosen the screws.
483)  KENNY
[disappointed]I got nothin'. [to himself]Shit!
484)  LEE
[pickup2]Hang tight... maybe I can scrounge something.
485)  KENNY
[pickup2]Well shit, man, go see if you can get the bolts off!
486)  LEE
[pickup2] I got a coin off Larry!
497)  LEE
[pickup2] I got a coin off Larry!
487)  
You wanna search Larry's pockets?
490)  
You wanna search Larry's pockets?
488)  
The air-conditioner might be our way out.
489)  
What now?
491)  
What now?
492)  LEE
[pickup2][half to himself]The air-conditioner!
493)  
I need a coin or something...
494)  LEE
[pickup2][insistent]Listen, I need a coin or something.
495)  LEE
[pickup2][more insistent]It's important!  It could get us out of here!
496)  KENNY
