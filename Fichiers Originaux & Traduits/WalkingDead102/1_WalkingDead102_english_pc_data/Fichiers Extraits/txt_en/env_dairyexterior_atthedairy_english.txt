1)  LEE
{ThinkingA}C'est quoi ça ?
2)  ANDY
{HappyA}Un générateur. Vous êtes venu avec votre carburant à point nommé.
3)  LEE
[to himself]{ThinkingA}On dirait une mangeoire pour la vache.
4)  LEE
[to himself]{HappyA}Ca doit être génial d'avoir du maïs à disposition comme ça.
5)  LEE
[to himself]Une clôture électrique fait maison... une bonne idée.
6)  LEE
[to himself]{SadA}Le courrier c'est terminé ces temps-ci.
7)  DANNY
Ouais, on ne s'en sert plus vraiment. On n'a plus qu'une seule vache, et on a déjà amené la plupart de son foin.
8)  LEE
Beaucoup de foin.
9)  DANNY
Ouais. C'est pour notre vache. Les gens sont toujours surpris de voir tout ce que ça peut avaler ces bestioles.
10)  LEE
{ThinkingA}Je peux vous aider ?
11)  DANNY
{NormalB}Nan, il y a plus rien à faire par ici.
12)  ANDY
{normalB}Heu, les armes que vous portez, {normalC}vous devez les laisser dehors. C'est interdit à l'intérieur.
13)  ANDY
{happyB}Ca sent bon, hein ?
14)  LEE
{happyA}C'est sûr.  {normalA}Ca doit être un des avantages de vivre dans une ferme. Surtout de nos jours.
15)  ANDY
{thinkingA}Maintenant, Maman insiste. {happyA}Pas d'inquiétudes, je n'ai pas vu de morts se balader dans les environs aujourd'hui. {normalC}Et puis, Danny et moi sommes préparés à affronter les problèmes.
16)  ANDY
{happyB}Et voilà.  La ferme laitière de la famille St. John.

{happyB}Et voilà.  La ferme laitière de la famille St. John.
17)  MARK
{happyA}C'est magnifique.
18)  LILLY
{thinkingA}On en a besoin. On doit manger.  {sadA}Surtout toi, papa. {normalC}Tu dois garder tes forces.
19)  LARRY
{angryA}Et tu es sûre qu'on peut leur faire confiance ?
20)  LARRY
{angryA}Hé bien, Lee aurait pu ramener à manger à tout le monde, {normalC}pas juste à ceux restés en retrait.
21)  LEE
{normalC}Ben avait trop peur qu'un brigand nous attaque.  {normalB}Mais il a quand même besoin de manger.
22)  LARRY
{normalC}Si vous voulez mon avis, ce gamin a besoin de s'en faire pousser une bonne paire.
23)  LILLY
{normalC}Doug a aménagé l'endroit de façon à être au courant si des marcheurs errent dans le coin.  {normalA}Ben aura droit à un apprentissage accéléré d'autodéfense.
24)  LILLY
{normalA}J'ai demandé à Carley de le surveiller.  Elle sait se débrouiller toute seule.  {normalB}Je suis sûre qu'elle peut le former à la dure si besoin.
25)  LARRY
[offended]{angryA}Maintenant, écoutez moi-
26)  KENNY
{sadA}Hé, Lee... je peux vous parler une seconde ?
27)  KENNY
[quietly] {angryA}Je sais pas, c'était verrouillé.
28)  LEE
[quietly] {angryA}Il y a quoi à l'intérieur ?
29)  KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}C'est sûrement rien, mais... {normalA}J'étais dans la grange pour aider à charger du foin, {thinkingA}et on dirait qu'ils ont une réserve à l'arrière.
30)  KENNY
[quietly] {thinkingA}Alors que personne ne faisait attention, j'ai jetté un coup d'oeil à travers la porte. {angryA}Ils ont tout un tas de boîtes en carton là-dedans. [acuseatory]{normalB}Ils stockent des trucs. {angryA}Il faut que quelqu'un sache ce que c'est.
31)  LEE
{normalC}Quoi de neuf ?
32)  LEE
[alt. To Himself]{DisgustA}Au moins ils n'ont plus à se soucier des factures.
33)  
Porte de la grange
34)  LEE
[pickup1][looking at the barn doors]Vous gardez vos vivres là-dedans ?
35)  ANDY
[pickup1][when asked about keeping livestock in the barn]Avant oui.  Maintenant c'est juste pour une seule vache, et elle ne va pas très bien.
36)  ANDY
[pickup1][alt - depending on who is closer to the Barn Loft]Ouais, on ne s'en sert plus vraiment.  On a plus qu'une vache vivante, et on a chargé la plupart de son foin.
37)  ANDY
[pickup1][alt - depending on who is closer to Hay]Ouais. C'est pour notre vache. Les gens sont toujours surpris de voir tout ce que ça peut avaler ces bestioles.

45)  ANDY
[pickup1][friendly]Dépêchez-vous, le dîner vous attend !
46)  LILLY
[pickup1][thanking Andy for the food] On ne vous remerciera jamais assez pour ça.
47)  ANDY
[pickup1][insistant that Lee leaves his weapons outside]Voyons, Lee.  J'ai dit pas d'armes.
48)  ANDY
[pickup1][insistant that Lee leaves his weapons outside]J'étais sérieux.  Les armes restent dehors.
49)  LARRY
[pickup1][annoyed that Lee is delaying their meal by not leaving his weapons outside]Vous commencez à me courir sur les nerfs, Lee.  Faîtes ce qu'il vous dit.

[pickup2] [To Himself]On dirait du propane.
53)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself]J'espère qu'ils vont pas me demander de nettoyer ce truc.
54)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] Ca devait être un chouette endroit pour les enfants... avant que tout cela n'arrive.
55)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] Elle n'a sans doute pas servi depuis des mois. C'est un peu flippant de la voir comme ça.
56)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}"Voyages gratuits" ? Je doute qu'ils offrent quoi que ce soit gratuitement maintenant.
57)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}Ils ont bien construit ça eux-même. Aucun doute.
58)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}Ca l'air dangereux mais j'imagine que c'est le but.
59)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}Je me demande quelle quantité de nourriture ils ont là-dedans. {ThinkingA}Heureusement on va le savoir.
60)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] Brenda fait à manger depuis un bon moment.
61)  LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}Original mais un peu inutile en terme de protection cependant.
62)  LEE
[pickup2] {ThinkingA}Ils stockent de l'essence un peu partout dans la propriété.
63)  LEE
[pickup2] {ThinkingA}Le carburant permet d'alimenter le générateur qui alimente la clôture.
64)  LEE
[pickup2] Je ne sais rien de ces types. Je ferais mieux de garder l'oeil ouvert une fois à l'intérieur.
65)  ANDY
[pickup2] Vous verrez comment on a gardé cet endroit si sûr.
66)  MARK
[pickup2] La clôture les empêche de passer ?
67)  DANNY
[pickup2] Et comment ! Ils grillent comme des insectes dans un tue mouche électrique.
68)  ANDY
[pickup3] On fait passer 4000 volts là-dedans, grâce aux générateurs et aux amplis.
69)  CARLEY
[pickup2] On va supposer que ça fait beaucoup...
70)  
Il n'y a jamais eu d'accident ?

75)  ANDY
[pickup2] [happy as a clam] Ca nous convient très bien.
393)  ANDY
[pickup2] [happy as a clam] Ca nous convient très bien.
76)  LEE
[pickup2] [impressed] C'est vraiment une installation géniale.
77)  LEE
[pickup2] On a des enfants dans le groupe, ça me semble dangereux de les laisser à proximité d'une clôture mortelle.
78)  DANNY
[pickup2] Heu, ce que veut dire Andy c'est qu'on a tout ce qu'il faut pour les distraire LOIN de tout danger.
79)  ANDY
[pickup2] Vos enfants ont des oreilles, non ? Assurez-vous qu'ils s'en servent.
395)  DANNY
[pickup2] Vos enfants ont des oreilles, non ? Assurez-vous qu'ils s'en servent.

396)  ANDY
[pickup2] Et on va supposer que votre ami là, heu, Lee, reste sans voix.
81)  CARLEY
[pickup2][impressed] C'est ça.
82)  ANDY
[pickup3] It's worth protecting, hence all the juice.
83)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Je pensais bien avoir vu arriver toute la compagnie dans l'allée !

143)  DOUG
[pickup2][nerve wracked] Vous avez de quoi manger ? On a tellement faim.
93)  LEE

94)  LEE

95)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Voici pour vous. Fraîchement cuits de ce matin.
96)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Andy, soit un amour et va porter l'essence au générateur quatre, à côté de la cuisine. Il est presque à sec.
97)  DANNY
[pickup2] [proud]Sans vache pour le lait et le beurre on peut plus avoir ces trucs maintenant, c'est certain.
98)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Incroyable !
99)  BRENDA
[pickup2] C'est vrai. Heureusement Maybelle va se remettre de ce qu'elle a et sera avec nous encore longtemps.
100)  BRENDA
[pickup2][quiet, talking in a background convo]  Je ne suis pas sûr, ce n'est pas comme la dernière fois et à l'époque on avait de l'aide.
101)  MARK

109)  MARK
[pickup2][wishes it was forever] Peut-être que tout notre GROUPE pourrait venir... pour la journée...
110)  DANNY
[pickup2] Nous pourrions accepter un peu plus d'aide ici. Nous sommes que trois et Maybelle...
111)  BRENDA
[pickup2][excited] Un vétérinaire ! Seigneur, vous avez exhaussé nos prières !
112)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Bien, vous tous allez chercher votre amie et je prépare le dîner, que dîtes-vous de ça ? Un grand festin pour ces pauvres âmes affamées.
113)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Qu'en pensez-vous ?
114)  LEE
[pickup2] Votre vache est malade ? Qu'est-ce qu'elle--
115)  LEE
[pickup2] Partons les gars, on a ce qu'on est venu chercher et notre groupe nous attend.
116)  BRENDA
Oh, vous partez ? Ah. C'est dommage, je pensais--
117)  MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] Allez, les gars ! C'est notre chance. Nous aidons ces gens et on peut QUITTER ce motel pourri.
118)  CARLEY
[pickup2][in a huddle] Je sais pas, Mark. On vient juste de les rencontrer.
119)  CARLEY
[pickup2][in a huddle]Ce n'est pas si simple.
120)  MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] DES BISCUITS, CARLEY. Des biscuits.
121)  MARK
[pickup2][outburst] Vendu ! On vous amène notre véto et on ramène la troupe ici !
122)  MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] C'est une gentille dame du sud qui vous a donné des BISCUITS.
123)  CARLEY
[pickup2][in a huddle] Laissons LEE décider.
124)  MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] Allez, Lee.
125)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Pourquoi je pourrais pas repartir avec la nourriture, rassembler tout le monde et revenir avec eux ?
158)  DOUG
[pickup2] Pourquoi je pourrais pas repartir avec la nourriture, rassembler tout le monde et revenir avec eux ?
126)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Merveilleux ! On dîne à sept heures ! En attendant, venez tous et détendez vous.
127)  
On les aide.
128)  
Je n'aime pas ca. On rentre.
129)  CARLEY
[pickup2]Vous êtes sûr ?
130)  LEE
[pickup2]Mark a raison. On les aide, ils nous aident et on améliore notre situation.
131)  LEE
[pickup2] Les fils sont un peu bizarres mais quel autre choix nous avons ?
132)  LEE
[pickup2] On est ravi de vous aider. Un dîner ce sera super.
133)  MARK
[pickup2] Pour sûr.
134)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Et je vais vous trouver quelque chose pour vous remplir l'estomac.
135)  ANDY
[pickup2] Mark et Lee, installez vous et venez me voir quand vous serez prêt à m'aider pour re-sécuriser le périmètre.
136)  CARLEY
[pickup2] On est sûr de rien. On ne sait pas s'ils veulent héberger tout un groupe sur la durée. Je resterai au Motor Inn avec le petit nouveau et donnerai la direction de la ferme aux autres. Le motel est un trou à rat mais on devrait y garder quelques défenses jusqu'à ce qu'on sache qu'on en part vraiment.
137)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Envoyez Kenny me remplacer après le dîner, avec un doggie bag de préférence. Et si tout se passe bien, on fera TOUS le déplacement.
138)  LEE
[pickup2] C'est un bon plan, Carley. Désolé que vous manquiez tout.
139)  DOUG
[pickup2] Oh, waouh, vous devez connaître un ou deux truc sur le câblage, vous.
140)  DANNY
[pickup2] On a eu un gars comme ça, ouais.
391)  ANDY
[pickup2] On a eu un gars comme ça, ouais.

144)  DOUG
[pickup2][blurts out] On a tous la méga-dalle !
145)  DOUG
[pickup2][seeing fresh food for the first time]Doux Jésus !
150)  DOUG
[pickup2] Ces gars sont space, Lee. Et c'est moi qui vous le dit.
151)  LEE
[pickup2] Nan, on a à manger. Je le sens pas de venir ici. Rentrons.
152)  MARK
[pickup2]LEE ! C'est dingue ! REGARDE cet endroit.
153)  LEE
[pickup2] Merci mais non.
154)  DOUG
[pickup2][in a huddle] On devrait laisser Lee décider.
155)  DOUG
[pickup2] [in a huddle]Ouais, mais vous comprenez. On peut pas réfléchir le ventre vide.
156)  DOUG
[pickup2] [wary][in a huddle]On devrait bien y réfléchir.
157)  MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle]DES BISCUITS, DOUG. Des biscuits. Vous allez me dire que d'entre TOUS ici VOUS n'aimez pas les BISCUITS ?
159)  DOUG
[pickup2] Envoyez Kenny me remplacer après le dîner. Avec un doggie bag, peut-être ? Et si tout se passe bien, on fera TOUS le déplacement.
160)  DOUG
[pickup2] Et si on ralentissait un peu ? On n'a pas intérêt à LAISSER le Motor Inn au cas où ça marche pas ici, pas vrai ? Je vais rester là-bas avec le petit nouveau, travailler sur mon système d'alarme et donner au groupe la direction pour venir ici. On devrait laisser quelqu'un au motel jusqu'à ce qu'on sache qu'on en parte vraiment.
161)  LEE
[pickup2] C'est un bon plan, Doug. Merci de prendre sur toi. Désolé que tu doives tout rater.
162)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Je vois pourquoi vous êtes si durs en affaire.
163)  ANDY
[pickup2] C'est des biens de valeur, je ne vous en veux pas de vouloir les garder.
164)  DOUG
[pickup2] Vous devez consommer une TONNE de fuel.
165)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Hé bien vous êtes au bon endroit !
166)  
We're empty handed.
167)  CARLEY
[pickup2] But please, we are so hungry.
168)  LEE
[pickup2] We're empty handed. Your boys wanted fuel for food but we said we had to see the place ourselves.
169)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Oh my goodness, thank you.
170)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Ya'll should take these fresh-baked biscuits, as a sign of our good faith. Ya'll can bring a couple tanks a fuel back here as payment.

174)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Pay no mind, darlin'!
175)  CARLEY
[pickup2] But we didn't bring any fuel, like your boys asked.
176)  DOUG
[pickup2] But we're all real hungry.
177)  DOUG
[pickup2] But we didn't bring any fuel, like your sons wanted.
178)  DOUG
[pickup2] [seeing food for the first time in days]Really?! Thank you so much!
179)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Well, if you change your mind...
180)  BRENDA
[pickup2]You'd be pretty valuable to an operation like this. Especially with a vet.
181)  BRENDA
[pickup2] Aww my goodness, we are sorry to hear that. We could really use the help and would make it worth ya'lls while.
182)  LEE
[pickup2] We better get going.
183)  CARLEY
[pickup2] Bye. Take care.
184)  MARK

561)  DANNY
[pickup3]How about I go have a little talk with them?
562)  DANNY
[pickup3][follows 310497904]When you're ready to go scope out that bandit camp, come find us.
563)  ANDY
[pickup3][nervous that Lee is messing with the generator] {FearA}Hey, uh, don't mess with that okay?  {ThinkingA}The things a litle tricky and I don't wanna spend half a day trying to fix it again.
564)  LEE
[pickup2] So Larry, it looks like you're getting along with Brenda pretty well.
565)  LARRY
[pickup2] You know, for a nice change of pace, how about you try minding your own fucking business?
566)  MARK
I could see myself staying here for a long time.
567)  LEE
You want to leave the motel?
568)  MARK
The motel's not going to hold up much longer.
569)  MARK
So what do you think, Lee? Should we stick around here?
570)  MARK
[pickup3][standing in pain - medium]
571)  MARK
[pickup3][standing in pain - medium]
572)  MARK
[pickup3][standing in pain - mild]
573)  MARK
[pickup3][standing in pain - mild]
574)  MARK
[pickup3][standing in pain - heavy]
575)  MARK
[pickup3][standing in pain - heavy]
576)  MARK
[pickup3][alt- in pain from an arrow wound, but trying to be a man about it]Yeah... I'll be all right once it's out, but, goddamn it hurts!
578)  LEE
[pickup3][explaining Lilly & Kenny Arguing.  follows #310498201] {ThinkingA}They don't exactly see eye to eye on how we should be doing things.
579)  LEE
[pickup3][explaining Lilly & Kenny's arguing] {HappyA}Each of them want to be in charge, you know?
580)  LEE
[pickup3][explaining Lilly & Kenny fighting]{ThinkingA}They have different ideas about how we should run our group.  If they don't find any common ground, this whole thing's gonna fall apart.
581)  KENNY
[pickup3]All right, Duck, let's let Clementine have a try for a bit.
582)  KENNY
[pickup3]All right, Duck, time to take a break.
583)  KENNY
[pickup3][neutral greeting]What's up Lee?
584)  KENNY
[pickup3][Duck reallly want to get back on the swing]Okay, Duck, don't pop a gasket.
585)  KENNY
[pickup3]Okay, Duck, ready to go again?
586)  KENNY
[pickup3][ambient]Not too high now.
587)  KENNY
[pickup3][ambient]Be careful .
588)  KENNY
[pickup3][ambient]Kick harder.
589)  KENNY
[pickup3][ambient]Nice air.
590)  KENNY
[pickup3][ambient]See if you can make it over the top.
591)  KENNY
[pickup3][commenting on the repaired swing]Nice work, Lee.
593)  
Does that offer apply to the rest of us?
595)  DANNY
[pickup3][normal] Had a guy who did, yeah.
596)  ANDY
[pickup3]Oh, don't worry about that.  We've got plenty to keep 'em entertained.
597)  DOUG
[pickup3][seeing the dairy for the first time]Oh, wow!  You've got enough electricity to run the whole place!
598)  CARLEY
[pickup3][seeing the dairy for the first time]This place looks untouched!  You'd never know the rest of the world is in ruins.
599)  ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He's from Macon.
600)  BRENDA
[pickup3]A couple of our old farm hands were from Macon. They grow 'em good there.
601)  ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He been living down at that old Motel round the way.
602)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Oh my goodness, that place is pretty vulnerable.  Have you got someone with survival experience to lead your group?
603)  ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He moves around a lot, but with things the way they are, maybe we can convince him to stick around for a while.
604)  ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He's ah... ya never did say where you were from.
605)  LEE
[pickup3]You were right.  I'm a local boy.
606)  DANNY
[pickup3][normal]They've got a few more friends staying at the old motel.
607)  
We work together.
608)  
Lilly keeps us focused on survival..
609)  
Kenny's working on getting us somewhere safer.
610)  
I've got things under control.
611)  LEE
[pickup3] I've got things under control over there.
612)  BRENDA
[pickup3] Sounds like a smart man.
613)  LEE
[pickup3]Kenny's working on getting us somewhere safer... He doesn't think the motor inn will stay safe forever.
614)  LEE
[pickup3]Lilly.  She's tough as nails and keeps us focused on what it takes to survive.
615)  LEE
[pickup3]We all work together.  Plus, we've got plenty of people with military experience.
616)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, I hope you know what you're doing.  That place isn't safe like it is here.
617)  MARK
[pickup3]Lilly was in the military, like me.
618)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, thats good to hear.  That motel ain't the safest place.
619)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, thats good to hear.  That motel ain't the safest place.
620)  ANDY
[pickup3][catching Lee in a lie] Hold on.  I thought you said someone else was running things?
621)  LEE
[pickup3][caught in a lie]Oh, yeah, I thought she was asking about survival tactics...
622)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, it don't matter.  You're here now.  We'll make sure you're safe and comfortable.
623)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Now that y'all are here, we'll make sure you're safe and comfortable.
624)  LEE
[pickup3]Does that offer apply to the rest of us?
625)  DOUG
[pickup3][stuffing buscutis into his mouth]Sorry.
627)  BRENDA
[pickup3]It'll be nice to have some folks to help out around here again. Danny, why don't you come help me out in the kitchen.
628)  DOUG
[pickup3]No problem.  Ben can come with me.
629)  ANDY
[pickup3]You might wanna take someone with you. Remember, those roads can be dangerous.
630)  MARK
[pickup3]Take this.
631)  BEN
[pickup3]Thanks.
632)  MARK
[pickup3]Why don't you go ahead and take Ben along anyway.
633)  CARLEY
[pickup3]I can handle myself.
634)  CARLEY
[pickup3][heartfelt] Take care of yourself, Lee.  See ya in a while.
635)  DOUG
[pickup3]All right!  See ya later!
636)  ANDY
[pickup3] Mark, Lee, why don't ya take a look around.  Once ya get settled in, I could use some help securin' the perimeter.
637)  ANDY
[pickup3]Sometimes, the dead get tangled up in the fence before they fry and end up knocking over a post.  It'd be a big help if you two could walk the perimeter.
638)  LEE
[pickup3]Is there a problem? [with the fence?]
639)  MARK
[pickup3]  [slightly hushed] This place is INCREDIBLE!!  It's got food!  And that fence... oh man that fence!! If we play our cards right, this might turn out to be a place we can stay. So how do you want to play this?
640)  
We should do whatever we can to help out!
641)  
Let's make sure the place is safe.
642)  LEE
[pickup3]Before we can think about bringing our whole group here to stay, we need to figure out if this place is as safe as they say.
643)  LEE
[pickup3] They are offering us food, we should do whatever we can to make these people like us!
644)  MARK
[pickup3]Right.  Obviously THEY think it's safe, but is it safe enough for the kids?  I noticed a broken swing over there.  Not a big deal, but maybe there's other things not working that we just can't see yet.
645)  LEE
[pickup3]And checking the fence perimeter sounds like a decent way to get a good look at their defences.
646)  LEE
[pickup3]All the more reason for us to NOT fuck this up.  If Andy need's some help securing the perimeter, then that's what we do.
647)  MARK
[pickup3]I noticed a broken swing over there, too.  Fixing that up might earn us some brownie points.  Plus I'm sure Duck and Clem would love it!
648)  LEE
[pickup3]All right.  Let's go be model house guests!
649)  MARK
[pickup3]The way Brenda was talking, I get the feeling like she'd be happy to have us stay.
650)  MARK
[pickup3]All right, I'll keep my eyes open and you find out what you can from Andy.
651)  
The electric fence came on!
652)  LEE
[pickup3]The electric fence came on!  Some people started attacking from the woods and we got trapped between them and the fence!
653)  ANDY
[pickup3][flustered]I... I heard Mark yell and thought y'all were giving me the all clear! [sincere]Man, I am real sorry.
654)  ANDY
[pickup3][suprised and concerned] Bandits!? Here?!  On our property?!
655)  LEE
[pickup3][having been attacked by Bandits] I thought this place was safe!
656)  ANDY
[pickup3]Fucking bandits!  They have no right being out here on our property!
657)  DANNY
[pickup3][looking at the arrow in Marks shoulder]Holy shit!  Are you okay?
659)  KATJAA
[pickup3][seeing an arrow in Marks shoulder] Mark!  Oh my god, what happened?!
660)  MARK
[pickup3][in pain from the arrow, but manning up]Yeah, I'm fine.  I should just... pull it out...
662)  LEE
[pickup3][calming down after the attack]We ran into some people on the way up here... bandits I guess.  I think it was them that attacked us.
663)  DANNY
[pickup3][normal]Food for protection. {fearA} Not like we had much of a choice, but they did stop hasslin' us.
664)  
It isn't as safe here as we thought.
665)  LEE
[pickup3]Maybe it isn't as safe here as we thought.
666)  ANDY
[pickup3]Hey kids, look what Lee got working for ya!
667)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]A swing!!  I love swings!  Just like at my treehouse!  Come on, Duck!
668)  ANDY
[pickup3][commending Lee for fixing the swing for the kids]You're a good guy, Lee.  Nice Job.
669)  ANDY
[pickup3]No wonder you're the leader of your group!
670)  ANDY
[pickup3]Hey, I remembered seeing kids in your group, so I went ahead and fixed that swing while you were out.  Hope you kids like swings!
671)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][stops to thank lee before running off to play]Thanks Lee!  You're the best!
672)  ANDY
[pickup3]Anytime.  We're looking out for ya!
673)  LEE
[pickup3][for fixing the swing for the kids]Thanks.
674)  KENNY
[pickup4]What we need to do is find a way to get our whole group out here to stay.  Take this place over if we have to.
675)  LARRY
[pickup3]Cool your jets there, Rambo.  These are nice people. Let's not do anything to get us thrown out before we eat!
676)  KENNY
[pickup4]Not safe?!  This place is a hell of a lot safer than that motor inn!  I think all of us and our guns can handle a couple of punks with bows and arrows!
677)  LILLY
[pickup3][voicing her opinion but trying to keep it out of earshot]Bandits?  Are you serious?  This place isn't safe, we can't stay here.
678)  LEE
[pickup3]I'm gonna head out with Dan to find out more about these bandits.  Getting him off the property for a while should give you a chance to check out this place a little deeper.  See if there's a way to get them to let us stay for a while.
679)  LEE
[pickup3]Listen, Mark and I were scoping out the place before the bandits showed up.  Other than that, this place does seem pretty secure.
680)  LEE
[pickup3]I think getting on these people's good side is gonna be important.  They've already said they have plenty of food. If we can get them thinking that having us here will benefit them, then we all win.
681)  LARRY
[pickup3]We'll bring 'em a doggy bag or something.
682)  LEE
[pickup3]Where's Ben and Doug?
683)  LILLY
[pickup3]Since Doug ATE  half the biscuits on the way to get us, I had them stay back.  I still don't think we should be trying to stay here and someone's gotta watch the motor inn until we get back.
684)  LILLY
[pickup3]Since Carley and Ben ate some of the food on the way back to get us, she volunteered to stay behind and watch the motor inn until we get back.
685)  LEE
[pickup3]Where's Ben and Carley?
686)  LILLY
[pickup3][disgusted] Yeah, that's... real charming, dad.
687)  LEE
I'm gonna head out and help Dan deal with these bandits.  You guys should try to make friends with Andy and Brenda while Im gone.
688)  LARRY
[pickup3]Well that's easy.  I've got charm coming outta my ass.
689)  LILLY
[pickup3]They'll be fine.  We need to focus on what we are doing HERE.
690)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Looks like the fence runs around the entire property, not just the house.
691)  ANDY
[pickup3] {NormalA}Yep. Can't take any chances when it comes to safety.
692)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}The fence is fantasic.  We'll do whatever you want to help keep it running.
693)  ANDY
[pickup3]{HappyA}Well, clearing that perimeter is gonna be a big help.  Just let me know when you're ready.
694)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself]{ThinkingB}I guess Mark and I were lucky we weren't touching this thing when it came on.
695)  ANDY
[pickup3] You betcha. They fry like bugs in a zapper.
696)  LEE
[pickup3] {ThinkingB}Make it safe for Clem and Duck, and let the St. John's know we can pull our weight around here.
697)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself looking at the broken swing] {ThinkingA}Looks like it just needs a new board for the seat and some rope.
714)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself looking at the broken swing] {ThinkingA}Looks like it just needs a new board for the seat and some rope.
698)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{SadA}Too bad it's broken. {ThinkingA}I'll bet Clementine and Duck would have loved something like this to play on.
699)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{NormalA}Kids used to like that old swing even more than the tour sometimes!
700)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{HappyA}I'll bet.
701)  
Mind if I try to fix it?
702)  
How long since it's been used?
703)  
How did it break?
704)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{HappyB}Sure!  That'd be great!  Momma sure does appreciate you all helping out.
705)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{HappyA}Mind if I fix it?
706)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard] {HappyC}Amen to that.
707)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard] {HappyA}I look forward to a day when kids can just be kids again.
708)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{ThinkingA}Been quite awhile. Don't exactly have a lot of kids visiting anymore.
709)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{DisgustA}When was the last time it got any use?
710)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{ThinkingA}How'd it break?
711)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{SadA}Got busted the first day those... things showed up.  Thank God no one was on it at the time.
712)  ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{ThinkingA}Looking for a place to relax before dealing with the outer fence?
713)  LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{DisgustA}Nah. Just looking around.
715)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}I've got some rope that should work...
716)  LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}I'm gonna need some rope.
717)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}...And there's got to be a board around here I can use as a seat.
718)  LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}...But that board I found is too long.
719)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}...And I've cut the board down to the right size.
720)  LEE
[pickup3][looking in the storage bench]{ThinkingA}This rope is perfect for the swing.
721)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Everything in here looks safe.  {ThinkingB}And now I know where to find some rope in case they need help tying anything down.
722)  LEE
[pickup3][looking in the storage bench]{DisgustA}Nothing else I need in here.
723)  LEE
[pickup3][looking at the fixed swing]{HappyA}All fixed.  That should make everyone happy!
724)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}This board is good, but I need some rope.
725)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}This rope will work great as soon as I find a board the right length.
726)  LEE
[pickup3][getting ready to fix he swing] All right, this shouldn't be too tough.
727)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}I'll bet they go through a lot of wood keeping those fences repaired.
728)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}This is too big right now, but if I can find something to cut it down to size, this might make a good seat for the swing.
729)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Mind if I use one of these boards?
730)  ANDY
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Already making some repairs, huh?  I like a guy who takes some initiative!  {HappyA}Yeah, go right ahead!
731)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}If a couple of tools out in the open is unsafe as it gets, we'll be fine here.
732)  LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}Would have been nice to have one of these back at the motor inn.
733)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Could be useful if I find some boards to cut.
734)  LEE
[pickup3][taking the saw in anticipation of cutting some boards.]  {ThinkingB}Hmm...
735)  BRENDA
[pickup3]You know, I used to push Andy and his brother out here on that swing every night when they were kids. [sighs] Seems like such a long time ago now.
736)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Did you say something darlin'?  [Then notices the repaired swing - Happy!] Oh my goodness. Did you do that?
737)  LEE
[pickup3]Just trying to help out a bit around here.
738)  LEE
[pickup3][calling out across the yard] Hopefully our kids will like it too.
739)  LEE
[pickup3]Yeah...it does.
740)  ANDY
[pickup3][calling out across the yard]Nice work, Lee. Things are starting to feel like they used to again.
741)  ANDY
[pickup3][seeing that Lee fixed the swing - To himself]Well I'll be damned.
742)  ANDY
[pickup3][calling out across the yard]Momma's gonna be thrilled to see that old swing all fixed up.
743)  ANDY
[pickup3][genuinely curious as to what Lee is working on.  NOT suspicious.]{SurprisedA}Hey... {DisgustA}What are ya fixing to do around the barn?
744)  ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]{ThinkingA}Ah, there'll be plenty of time for all that stuff later, after we go fix up the fence on the outer perimiter.
760)  ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]{ThinkingA}Ah, there'll be plenty of time for all that stuff later, after we go fix up the fence on the outer perimiter.
745)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Just trying to find more ways to help out!
746)  ANDY
[pickup3]{HappyA}Well, I appreciate that!
747)  ANDY
[pickup3]Tell ya what, {HappyB}We'll find ya something to do over there after we get back from securing the perimeter.
748)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
755)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
757)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
759)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
749)  LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}How secure is your barn?  Having a safe place for the cow is pretty important.
750)  ANDY
[pickup3]{NormalA}Thanks to the fence, nothing gets in here anymore.  {SadA}Unfortunately the deadies took most of our cattle before we got it running.
751)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Mind if I take a look?
758)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Mind if I take a look?
752)  ANDY
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Sure, but why don't we do that after we tend to the perimeter?
756)  ANDY
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Sure, but why don't we do that after we tend to the perimeter?
753)  LEE
[pickup3][responding to"What are ya fixing to do at the barn?"]{ThinkingA}Nothing.
754)  ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]{ThinkingA}Just giving yourself the tour, huh?
761)  
Just trying to help out.
762)  
I'm curious about your barn.
763)  
Nothing.
764)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - looking at the ribbons]{ThinkingA}These people put a lot of love into this dairy.
765)  ANDY
[pickup3][heartfelt]{SadA}This place was my daddy's life.  It meant everything to him.
766)  LEE
[pickup3][calling across the yard]{ThinkingA}This dairy won a lot of ribbons in it's day, huh?
767)  ANDY
[pickup3]{DisgustA}Then one day the world changed...Now this place is all we have left of Daddy.  {ThinkingA}That's why we take such good care if it, and why we want to share it with good folks like yourselves.
768)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Is that right?
769)  LEE
[pickup3]{NormalA}My folks stopped after two as well.
770)  ANDY
[pickup3][heartfelt]{HappyA}You know, when he first bought this place, this was a single story house.
771)  ANDY
[pickup3][heartfelt]{ThinkingA}After us kids were born, he insisted on adding a second floor.  Said they had to have room for as many babies as they could have. [with a smile]{SadA}...Momma was done after Dan.
772)  LEE
[pickup3][taking in a deep sniff] {HappyA}Mmmm, fresh herbs!  I can hardly wait for dinner!
773)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing][laughing]
774)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing]Push me higher!
775)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing]Wheee!
776)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing][giggling]
777)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing][giggling3]
778)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing]This is fun!
779)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing]I have a swing at my house too!
780)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][playing on the swing][giggling2]
784)  LEE
[pickup3][Responding to mark asking"how do we play this"]We'll just play it by ear.
785)  BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, you must be the veterinarian in the group!  Why don't you help me get your friend patched up, then we can talk about our poor cow.
786)  BRENDA
[pickup3]I've been fixing wounds around here for years. I've got enough gauze and needles to last a lifetime!
787)  KATJAA
[pickup3]Well, if you need help, I can keep the wound clean while you apply the stitches.
788)  KATJAA
[pickup3][concerned about Mark's wound]Do you have any antibiotics or anything to stop infection?
789)  DANNY
[pickup3][folows  310497904] They're hard to pin down, but I think I know where at least ONE of their camps are.
790)  LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I hope Mark is okay in there.
791)  LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}If there's not enough room in the house for all of us, I guess a few of us could camp out in here in shifts.
792)  LARRY
[pickup3][joking around/flirting]Well, we'll just see about that.
793)  BRENDA
[pickup3][process in the distance][joking around/flirting]Oh, Larry, now you behave or you won't get your hands on my biscuits all night!
794)  LARRY
[pickup3][process in the distance][joking around]...I haven't had biscuits like that since I was in the service!
795)  LEE
[pickup3][looking at gas cans][follows 310497452]{ThinkingB}We'll just have to make sure the kids don't get into it.
796)  LEE
[pickup3][follows 310497311]{ThinkingA}We're gonna need to learn how to maintain it if we end up staying here.
797)  LEE
[pickup3][looking at bales of hay] {ThinkingA}Enough of these might work as adequate cover from arrows if that becomes a problem.
798)  LARRY
[pickup3][ambient][process muted or positional]I know what you mean.  My girl is what keep me going.  If it weren't for her, I dont know if I'd bother putting up with what this world's become.
799)  BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient][process muted or positional]Oh now don't say that, we all have to look forward to something better.  At least we got our health!
800)  BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient]Oh I manage just fine.  Plus I have my boys to help out.  I couldn't do it without them.
801)  LARRY
[pickup3][ambient]So how does a woman like you self run this whole place?
802)  BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient][Laughs.]
843)  BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient][Laughs.]
803)  LARRY
[pickup3][ambient][process muted or positional]ah, ya better tell that to my ticker.
804)  MARK
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}So what have ya found out?  Is this looking like a good place to stay?
805)  LEE
[pickup3]{NormalA}I'll keep looking around.
806)  LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I didn't get a chance to check out the barn area yet.  {NormalA}I'll do that after after helping Andy get the perimeter secured.
807)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}The fence is no joke, at least around the house.  I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of it.
808)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}The generator might be a problem.  Andy said it's "tricky" and repairing it takes him a while.
809)  
I can't check the barn yet.
810)  
That fence is no joke!
811)  
The Generators might be a problem...
812)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Still, it's a hell of a lot more secure than the motor inn.
813)  MARK
[pickup3]{ThinkingB}All right.  Keep me posted.
814)  MARK
[pickup3]{ThinkingB}So what's your read on Andy so far?  Think they'd be open to letting us stay?
815)  MARK
[pickup3]{HappyA}I knew that'd be a good idea!
816)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}He and Brenda both seemed real happy to have that swing fixed.
817)  
Securing the perimeter will help a lot!
818)  MARK
[pickup3]{HappyA}We'll be getting in good AND making this place safer for us!
819)  LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Getting the perimeter secured is gonna help us a lot.
820)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}I'm gonna get back to it.
821)  LEE
[pickup3][to himself - looking at the generatior]{FearA}I'm glad Andy knows how to fix this if something goes wrong.  {ThinkingA}I'm clueless about this stuff.
822)  MARK
[pickup3]{SadA}Dammit.
823)  LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I may have pushed too hard asking Brenda about her house...
824)  
Andy seems open to guests.
825)  LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Andy tells me they've had guest stay here before.  That tells me they are open to the idea.
826)  MARK
[pickup3]{HappyB}Thats fantastic!
827)  
Andy might think we're dangerous.
828)  LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I may have turned Andy off when talking up our guns.
829)  MARK
[pickup3]{AngryA}Shit, well ... do something to turn him on again!
830)  MARK
[pickup3]{SadA}You know what I mean.
